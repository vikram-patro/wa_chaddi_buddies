 Law of equality 💠

The time taken by a wife when she says I'll get ready in 5 min is exactly equal to the time taken by husband when he says 'I'll call u in 5 min!📞📱

〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰
Listening to wife 👸is like reading the terms & conditions of website.
You understand Nothing😪, still you click 
"I Agree"😝......!!

I argued👿... She argued👿...
I shouted😡... She shouted😡 and then she cried😭

Result: she won by duckworth lewis method😱

Chess is the only game in the world,

[28/12/13, 10:24:37 AM] Vikram: MUST READ U WILL FALL DOWN LAUGHING

Jignesh "My elbow really hurts. I guess I should see a doctor."?

His friend "Don't be so desi. There's computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor. 
Simply put in a sample of your urine, and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10.00."??? 

Jignesh figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. 
Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00. 

The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause, out popped a small slip of paper which read?? You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water, avoid heavy labor. It will be better in two weeks. 

That evening, while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, Jignesh began to wonder if this could be fooled. 

He decided to give it a try. 
He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. 

He went back to the drug store, located the computer, poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00.? The machine again made the usual noises, flashed lights, and printed out the following analysis:??? 

1. Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener.? 
2. Your dog has ringworm. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo.? 
3. Your daughter is getting' screwed by three guys at the same time and has urinary infection. Put her on Antibiotic and keep a track of her outings. 
4. Your wife is pregnant . . . twins.  They aren't yours. Get a lawyer. 
5. And Bhosadi-ke, If you don't stop masturbating, your elbow will not get cured!! 😜😜

🐣Chicken Story🐣
(Mind blowing climax):

A farmer 👳 rears  25 young hens 🐤 and one old cock 🐔...
As he feels that the old cock could no longer handle his job efficiently, the farmer bought one young cock 🐓 from the market...

Old cock 🐔to Young cock 🐓:

🐔Old cock: Welcome to join me, we will work together towards productivity...

🐓Young cock: What do you mean? As far as I know, you are old & should be retired.

🐔Old cock : Young boy, there are 25 hens here, can't I help you with some?

🐓Young cock: No!! Not even one, all of them will be mine.

🐔Old cock: In this case, I shall challenge you to a competition & if I win you shall allow me to have one hen & if I lose you will have
all.

🐓Young cock:  OKKK..
What kind of competition?

🐔Old cock: 50 meters run. From here to that tree. But due to my age, I hope you allow me to start off the first 10 meters.

🐓Young cock: No problem ! We will compete tomorrow morning.

In the morning the Young cock allows the Old cock to start off 
🐔💨 & when the Old cock crosses the 10 meters mark the Young cock chases 🐓💨 him with all his might.

Soon enough, he was behind the Old cock's back 🐔🐓💨in a matter of seconds. 

Suddenly..."BANG"💥!!! 

Before he could overtake the old cock, he was shot 🔫 dead by the farmer 👳...
who cursed,
 
👳: "Hell" 

This is the 5th GAY cock I've bought this week." ??


Moral: beware of senior experience in corporate politics !!!!!

[07/02/14, 8:45:44 AM] ~ Phan!: Only 1 min....................Enjoy reading this ❤
🎾🎾🎾 Please read this to  the end. 

My name is God. You hardly have time for me. I love you and alwys bless u. I am always with you.  I need you to spend 30mns of your time with Me today. Don't pray. Just praise. Today I want this message across the world before midnight. Will you help ? Please do not  cut it and I'll help you with something that you are in need of. Just dare Me ! A blessing is coming your way. Pls Drop everything & pass it on. Tomorrow will be the Best Day of your Life. Don't break this chain. Send this to 14 friends in 10mins.👼👷💂👧👩👴👵

Why Do we feel sleepy in Prayer, 
😞
But stay awake through a 3 hour movie?🌅

Why are we so bored when we look at the HOLY RELIGIOUS 📖

But find it easy to read other books?
📚
Why is it so easy to ignore a msg about God,📖

Yet we forward the nasty ones?

Why are Prayers getting smaller,

But bars and clubs are expanding?
🚬🍻🍺🍷
Why is it so easy to worship a celebrity,

But very difficult to engage with God?

Think about it, are you going to forward this?

Are you going to ignore it, cause you think you will get laughed at?

Forward this to all your friends.

80% of you won't forward this.

God  said:
If you deny me in front of your
friends, I will deny you on the day of judgment: 

When one door closes , God opens two : If God has opened  doors for you, 

send this message to all ur frnz....!!!

[19/03/14, 7:52:25 PM] Gablooooo...: Awesome message.. Read Carefully:

THE BOILING FROG SYNDROME..!!

Human Beings and frogs are the two creatures in nature who have tremendous power to adjust...

Put a frog in a vessel of water and start heating the water...

As the temperature of the water rises, the frog is able to adjust its body temperature accordingly...

The frog keeps on adjusting with increase in temperature...

Just when the water is about to reach boiling point, the frog is not able to adjust anymore...

At that point the frog decides to jump out...

The frog tries to jump but is unable to do so, because it lost all its strength in adjusting with the water temperature...

Very soon the frog dies. What killed the frog?

Many of us would say the boiling water...

But the truth is what killed the frog was its own inability to decide when it had to jump out...

We all need to adjust with people and situations, but we need to be sure when we need to adjust and when we need to confront / face...

There are times when we need to face the situation and take the appropriate action...

If we allow people to exploit us physically, mentally, emotionally or financially, they will continue to do so...

We have to decide when to jump...

Let us jump while we still have the strength !!

Think on It !! 👈

WHEN A LIZARD CAN, WHY CAN'T WE?

This is a true story that happened in Japan. 

In order to renovate the house, someone in Japan breaks open the wall. 

Japanese houses normally have a hollow space between the wooden walls.

When tearing down the walls, he found that there was a lizard stuck there because a nail from outside hammered into one of it's feet. 

He sees this, feels pity, and at the same time curious, as when he checked the nail, 
it was nailed 5 years ago when the house was first built !!!

What happened? 

The lizard has survived in such position for 5 years!!!!!!!!!! 

In a dark wall partition for 5 years without moving, it is impossible and mind-boggling.

Then he wondered how this lizard survived for 5 years! without moving a single step--since it's foot was nailed!

So he stopped his work and observed the lizard, what it has been doing, and what and how it has been eating. 

Later, not knowing from where it came, appears another lizard, with food in it's mouth.

Ah! He was stunned and touched deeply. 

For the lizard that was stuck by nail, another lizard has been feeding it for the past 5 years... 

Imagine? it has been doing that untiringly for 5 long years, without giving up hope on it's partner. 

Imagine what a small creature can do that a creature blessed with a brilliant mind can't. 

Please never abandon your loved ones

Never Say you're Busy When They Really Need You ...

You May Have The Entire World At Your Feet.....

But You Might Be The Only World To Them.... 

A Moment of negligence might break the very heart which loved you against all odds..

Before you say something just remember..it takes a moment to Break but an entire lifetime to make...

MUST SHARE.....👉👍

Test 3:
Men will always be Men - 
Once a group of men decided to go for Tirth Yatra. Their guide explained to them that they might see some ladies bathing in open and they should not get distracted at all. When they see anything like that, they should just say HARI OM and move on. Next day they started the yatra and one of the men in the group said- "HARI OM" and rest of them said- "KIDHAR HAI, KIDHAR HAI!" 😆

🚂🚋🚃🚋🚃🚋🚃🚋🚃

Life is like a journey on a train...
with its stations...
with changes of routes...
and with accidents ! 

We board this train when we are born and our parents are the ones who get our ticket. 

We believe they will always travel on this train with us.

However, at some station our parents will get off the train, leaving us alone on this journey.  

As time goes by, other passengers will board the train,  many of whom will be significant - our siblings, friends, children, and even the love of our life. 

Many will get off during the journey and leave a permanent vacuum in our lives.

Many will go so unnoticed that we won't even know when they vacated their seats and got off the train ! 

This train ride will be full of joy, sorrow, fantasy, expectations, hellos, good-byes, and farewells.

A good journey is helping, loving, having a good relationship with all co passengers...
and making sure that we give our best to make their journey comfortable.  

The mystery of this fabulous journey is ;
We do not know at which station we ourselves are going to get off.

So, we must live in the best way - adjust, forget, forgive, and offer the best of what we have. 

It is important to do this because when the time comes for us to leave our seat... we should leave behind beautiful memories for those who will continue to travel on the train of life.

Thank you for being one of the passengers on my train ! 

Have a very pleasant journey of life.........!

[21/08/14, 10:31:55 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Solve this: 

A guy came back home from a business trip to his beautiful wife. He clicked this picture of hers as soon as he got back. After a few days he killed his wife and put this photo in her pocket after killing her!! 
During his trial, he said that he killed his wife because she was cheating on him. The prosecutor asked, "What proof do you have?" 
The husband said, "That photo is the proof. Look carefully." 

Question - What did the man see in the picture that made him kill his wife?

The thing which has amazed me most is not the plight of people or security forces helping people.......

But......

The absence of Anti India protestors..
Stone Pelters...
Demanders of independence..
Slammers of security forces....

Where are those jihadists now??
Where is the bunch of idiots..hurriyat??
Where is geelani, YASIN malik and many more...

What about Pakistan.....which is self proclaimed messiah of kashmiris....

Ultimately....it is govt of India and Indian forces which are there to help the kashmiris......
please forward this

[12/09/14, 11:50:55 AM] Sandeep Vallapu: KAMASUTRA LESSONS:

1. Kamasutra says : If you suck one nipple, the women herself offers the other one. And that was the origin of "buy one get one free"!

2. Did you ever notice: everything on a woman's upper body starts with a "B". Blouse, Bra, Bikini, Boobs & lower body with a "P" Peticoat, panties, pussy... That's origin of "BP"!

3. Before sex, you help each other get naked. After sex, you dress only yourself. Moral: In life no one helps you once you're fucked.

4. Success is like pregnancy. Everybody congratulates you but nobody knows how many times you got fucked to achieve it.

5. What is the difference between frustration and satisfaction? What the Fuck! and What a Fuck!

6. 3 people having sex is a threesome, 2 is a twosome. So next time someone calls you 'HANDSOME', don't take it as a compliment!

7. Life is like a dick, sometimes it becomes hard for no reason.

8. Practical thought: A husband is supposed to make his wife's panties wet, not her eyes. A wife is supposed to make her husband's dick hard, not his life..!

Now that I've educated. you, go ahead and educate someone else.
LAST BUT BEST ONE...
When a lady is pregnant,

all her friends touch her stomach ad say "Congrats!".

But none of them come and touch the man's Penis and say "Well done!".

Moral: Hard work is never appreciated: Only result matters..

Prize winning message of the year.

[07/10/14, 5:18:40 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: Peter goes into a pharmacy and says to the pharmacist
"Hello, could you give me condom? I'm going to my girlfriend's place for dinner and I think I may be in with a chance!"
The pharmacist gives him the condom and as peter was going out he returns and says,"Give me another condom because my girlfriend's sister is very cute too. She always crosses her legs in a provocative manner when she sees me and I think I might strike a luck there too." The pharmacist gives him a second condom and as Peter was leaving again he turns back and says "Give me one more condom because my girlfriend's mum is still pretty cute and when she sees me she always makes eye contact and since she invited me for dinner I think she is expecting me to make a move. During dinner,peter sat with his girlfriend on d left, the sister on his right and the mum facing him. When the Dad walks in, Peter lowers his head and starts the dinner prayer."Dear Lord, bless this dinner and thank you for all u've given us".
10minutes after, peter was still praying "Thank you Lord for your kindness. ...."
 Ten minutes go by, and peter is still praying, keeping his head down, very close to d table. They all looked at each other surprised, and  his girlfriend was even more surprised than others. She gets close to him and whispered, "I didn't know u r so religious."Peter with his head still on d table replies, "I never knew your dad was a pharmacist!"

[18/12/14, 7:12:52 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: 💭 HILARIOUS TRUTH :

Every Man is Millionaire atleast by his sperm count... 

And the Funniest thing is that even these million are also spent on Women...!! 💄😢😆
😀😀😀.......................


😝👍1 sperm has 37.5 MB of DNA information in it, 

which means a normal fuck represents a data transfer of 1587 GB in about 3 seconds...

And we think 3G is fast !

😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝

The 1st Penis guard in Cricket was used in 1894 & the 1st Helmet was used in 1934.

MORAL: It took 40 yrs for men to realize that Brain is also an important part. But priority was always clear..... 👌

🔺If:

is equal to:

🔻Then,

🔹H+A+R+D+W+O+R+K;
8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11=98%

🔹K+N+O+W+L+E+D+G+E;

🔹L+O+V+E;
12+15+22+5 = 54%

🔹L+U+C+K ;
12+21+3+11 = 47%

🔸None of them makes 100%. Then what makes 100%?

🔸Is it Money? NO!

🔹M+O+N+E+Y= 13+15+14+5+25=72%

🔸Leadership? NO!

🔹L+E+A+D+E+R+S+H+I+P= 12+5+1+4+5+18+19+8+9+16=97%

🔸Every problem has a solution, only if we perhaps change our "ATTITUDE"...

🔹A+T+T+I+T+U+D+E ;
1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 💯%

It is therefore OUR ATTITUDE👍 towards Life and Work that makes

home drunk he beats me senseless. 

Doctor: "I have a real good medicine for that. When your husband comes home drunk, just drink some water and hold it in your mouth. hold it in but don't swallow until he goes to bed and is asleep.

Two weeks later the woman comes back to the doctor looking fresh and reborn.

Woman: "Doctor, that was a brilliant idea! Every time my husband came home drunk, I kept the water in my mouth. Held it in till he sleeps, and he didn't touch me!"

Doctor: "You see how much keeping your mouth shut helps".

After Rajnikanth, Alok nath & Alia bhatt, it's time for Arnab Goswami series.....
😜
After creating this complex world, GOD was worried, who will decide what is RIGHT and what is WRONG ? 
So he created ARNAB GOSWAMI.
😝😝😝😝😝😝
Arnab Goswami might probably be the only guy in this world to fight with his wife & win
😂😂😂😂😂😂
If we could place a mini turbine inside Arnab Goswami's throat, the resultant electricity can power all the Times group building.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Arnab Goswami is inversly proportional to Manmohan Singh
😂😂😂😂😂😂
If you find Arnab Goswami's pic with his mouth closed, then that camera has a very good shutter speed.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Arnab Goswami is fluent in English & weak in grammar  becoz he does not use full stop or comma
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
From the moon you can see the great wall of china and hear Arnab Goswami shouting "The nation wants to know"
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Proposed airport near Times Now studio cancelled as noise from newshour could weaken the structure and intercept signals
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
When Arnab Goswami says "I will speak now" , everyone looks puzzled , wondering who was speaking till now
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Whats the similarity between Arnab Goswami & google?
Both interrupt you before you complete the sentence
😂😂😂

[11/02/15, 8:09:50 PM] Abhijeet Singh Rathod: Ab rajnikant. Santa banta.. bandh karo. Naya comedy king kejriwal aa gaya hai Usko chance do..

Kejriwal is so Honest-

1. केजरीवाल जी वजन बताने वाली मशीन पर बिना कपड़ो के खड़े होते हैं ताकि वजन सही आ सके...
😜

2. केजरीवाल ने आज तक कोई भी LIC policy नहीं ली है, उनका कहना है की "HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY...."...
😄

3. एक बार maggi मे मसाला नहीं निकलने पर केजरीवाल ने Nestle पर धोखाधड़ी का Case कर दिया था...
😛

4. केजरीवाल अंडरवियर नही पहनते क्योंकि अंडरवियरों पे
वीआईपी लिखा होता है।
😆

5. केजरीवाल वो ईमानदार व्यक्ति है जिन्होंने अपनी शादी में लाखो का दहेज़ लेने के बाद... अपने ससुर जी को चंदे की पक्की रशीद काट के दी...।
😝😝

6. स्कूल मे अपने पिता का नाम पूछे जाने पर केजरीवाल DNA टेस्ट कराने चले गए थे...
OMG
🙊😉

7. केजरीवाल जी इतने इमानदार हैं की होटल मे खाना खाने के बाद वो सौफ और मिश्री का भी payment करते हैं...
Gr8
👍😂

8. एक बार केजरीवाल ने हलवाई पर इसलिए केस कर दिया था कि गुलाब जामुन में ना तो गुलाब था और न ही जामुन...
😄😂

9. एक बार कौवे ने झूठ बोला तो केजरीवाल जी ने उसे काट लिया।
🙊😅

10. गोलगप्पे खाने के बाद extra पापड़ी लेने का भी पैसा केजरीवाल देते हैं... 😛😛

11. केजरीवाल जी इतने ईमानदार हैं कि जब भी कहीं बम पाते हैं तो आतंकियों को लौटा देते हैं... 😊☺

12. सुप्रीम कोर्ट केजरीवाल की ईमानदारी से इतना प्रभावित है की अब गीता की जगह केजरीवाल जी की कसम खा कर बयान देना पड़ेगा 😊😜😝😄😃😛😣

[04/03/15, 12:37:09 AM] ~ 🤔: This is absolutely hilarious!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

A  Woman comes home and tells her husband,   

"Remember those headaches I've been having all these years? 
Well, they're gone."
"No more headaches?" 

The husband asks, "What happened?"

His wife replies, "Margie referred me to a hypnotist.  He told me to stand in front of a mirror, stare at myself and repeat....
" I do not have a headache "
" I do not have a headache  ",
"  I do not have a headache  " 
It worked!  
The headaches are all gone."

"Well, that is wonderful," replies the husband.
 
His wife then says, 
 "You know, you haven't been exactly a ball of fire in the bedroom these last few years.  

Why don't you go see the hypnotist and see if he can do anything for that?"

The husband agrees to try it.

Following his appointment, the husband comes home, rips off his clothes, picks up his wife and carries her into the bedroom.

He puts her on the bed and says, "Don't move, I'll be right back."

He goes into the bathroom and comes back a few minutes later and jumps into bed and makes passionate love to his wife like never before.

His wife says, "Boy, that was wonderful!"
The husband says, "Don't move! I will be right back."

He goes back into the bathroom, comes back and round two was even better than the first time.

The wife sits up and her head is spinning.

Her husband again says, "Don't move, I'll be right back."

With that, he goes back in the bathroom.

This time, his wife quietly follows him and there in the bathroom....... she sees him standing at the mirror and saying,
" She's not my wife."
" She's not my wife."
" She's not my wife! "

His funeral service will be held, this Sunday...😜😂😁😝

[24/03/15, 1:22:43 PM] ~ Phan!: Please give your 2min and read this:-

1 Let’s say it’s 7.25pm and you’re going home (alone of course) after an unusually hard day on the job.

2 You’re really tired, upset and frustrated. 

3 Suddenly you start experiencing severe pain in your chest that starts to drag out into your arm and up in to your jaw. You are only about five km from the hospital nearest your home.

4 Unfortunately you don’t know if you’ll be able to make it that far.

5 You have been trained in CPR, but the guy that taught the course did not tell you how to perform it on yourself.

6 HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE?
Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack without help, the person whose heart is beating improperly and who begins to feel faint, has only
about 10 seconds left before losing consciousness. 

7 However, these victims can help themselves by coughing
repeatedly and very vigorously. A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest. 

A breath and a cough must be repeated about every two
seconds without let-up until help arrives, or until
the heart is felt to be beating normally again.

8 Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughing
movements squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating. The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm. In this way, heart attack victims can get to a hospital. 

9 Tell as many other people as possible about this. It could save their lives!!

10 A cardiologist says If everyone who gets this mail
kindly sends it to 10 people, you can bet that we’ll save at least one life.

11 Rather than sending jokes, please..contribute by forwarding this mail which can save a person’s life….

12 If this message comes around you ……more than once…..please don’t get irritated……U need to be happy that you have many friends who care about you & being reminded of how to tackle….Heart attacks…. AGAIN…

DR.N Siva
(Senior Cardiologist)

Most easiest way you might save a life ONLY BY JUST Copy and paste...😊😊😊

[24/04/15, 9:57:25 PM] ~ Phan!: A Crow Lived in the Forest and was absolutely satisfied in life. 

But one day he saw a swan...
This swan is so white and I am so black...crow thought.

This swan must be the happiest bird in the world.

He expressed his thoughts to the swan. 
"Actually," the swan replied, 

"I was feeling that I was the happiest bird around until I saw a parrot, which has two colors. 
I now think the parrot is the happiest bird in creation." 

The crow then approached the parrot. 
The parrot explained, 
"I lived a very happy life—until I saw a peacock.
I have only two colors, but the peacock has multiple colors." 

The crow then visited a peacock in the zoo and saw that hundreds of people had gathered to see him. 

After the people had left, 
The crow approached the Peacock..

Dear Peacock, 
You are so beautiful. 
Every day thousands of people come to see you. 
When people see me, 
they immediately shoo me away. 
I think you are the happiest bird on the planet.

The peacock replied, 
I always thought that I was the most beautiful and happy bird on the planet. 
But because of my beauty, 
I am entrapped in this zoo. 

I have examined the zoo very carefully, and I have realized that the crow is the only bird not kept in a cage. 

So for past few days I have been thinking that if I were a crow, 
I could happily roam everywhere.

That's our problem too. 

We make unnecessary comparison with others and become sad. 

We don't value what has God given us. 
This all leads to the vicious cycle of unhappiness. 

Value the things god has given us. 

Learn the secret of being happy and discard the comparison which leads only to unhappines..
Some gyan!!

One day, her 9-year-old son hides in the closet during one of her romps. Her husband comes home unexpectedly, so she hides the lover in the closet.

The little boy says, "It's dark in here."
The man whispers, "Yes, it is."
Boy - "I have a baseball."
Man - "That's nice."
Boy - "Want to buy it?"
Man - "No, thanks."
Boy - "My dad's outside."
Man - "OK, how much?"
Boy - "$250."

In the next few weeks, it happens again that the boy and the mom's lover end up in the closet together.

Boy - "It's dark in here."
Man - "Yes, it is."
Boy - "I have a baseball glove."
Man - Remembering last time, asks, "How much?"
Boy - "$750."
Man - "Fine."

A few days later, the father says to the boy, "Grab your ball and glove. Let's go outside and toss the baseball."

The boy says, "I can't. I sold them."

The father asks, "How much did you sell them for?"

The son says "$1,000."

The father says, "It's terrible to overcharge your friends like that. That's way more than those two things cost. I'm going to take you to church and make you confess."

They go to the church and the father makes the little boy sit in the confession booth and he closes the door.

The boy says, "It's dark in here."
The priest says, "Don't start that crap again!"

[02/06/15, 12:15:32 AM] Suhail Ambrose: It's the first day of June...!!!

This is that wonderful time when some years back, the most exciting things of our lives used to happen.

> Our school used to re-open.

> For a moment, just think of it all.

> And try, if you can visualize those days.

> That excitement of a new bag.

> New books.

> The end of an exciting vacation, with a tinge of sadness.

> A bit of anxiety on the 1st day of another school year.

> The unforgetable smell from the pages of new books.

> New subjects.

> New teachers.

> New sitting positions of a class.

> And the most exciting was to welcome our best friends in the class.

> The sight of our secret 'crush' after a long gap.

> The pouring rains outside.

> The shopping for raincoat.

> Everything around us freshend up.

> Lush green.

> Cold and pleasant.

Wasn't it the most beautiful period of our lives.

It can never return...!!!

But you can always close your eyes for a moment, and try to relive it.

And don't forget to experience the same through the kidz heart.

Wishing everyone a 'nostalgic' June...!!!

[04/06/15, 11:05:44 AM] Abhijeet Singh Rathod: A beautiful speech by Sundar Pichai - an IIT-MIT Alumnus and Global Head Google Chrome:

The cockroach theory for self development👍
     
At a restaurant, a cockroach suddenly flew from somewhere and  sat on a lady. 

She started screaming out of fear. 

With a panic stricken face and trembling voice, she started jumping, with both her hands desperately trying to get rid of the cockroach.

Her reaction was contagious, as everyone in her group also got panicky.

The lady finally managed to push the cockroach away but ...it landed on another lady in the group.

Now, it was the turn of the other lady in the group to continue the drama.

The waiter rushed forward to their rescue.

In the relay of throwing, the cockroach next fell upon the waiter.

The waiter stood firm, composed himself and observed the behavior of the cockroach on his shirt.

When he was confident enough, he grabbed it with his fingers and threw it out of the restaurant.

Sipping my coffee and watching the amusement, the antenna of my mind picked up a few thoughts and started wondering, was the cockroach  responsible for their histrionic behavior?

If so, then why was the waiter not disturbed?

He handled it near to perfection, without any chaos.

It is not the cockroach, but the inability of those people to handle the disturbance caused by the cockroach, that disturbed the ladies.

I realized that, it is not the shouting of my father or my boss or my wife that disturbs me, but it's my inability to handle the disturbances caused by their shouting that disturbs me.

It's not the traffic jams on the road that disturbs me, but my inability to handle the disturbance caused by the traffic jam that disturbs me.

More than the problem, it's my reaction to the problem that creates chaos in my life.

Lessons learnt from the story:

I understood, I should not react in life.
I should always respond.

The women reacted, whereas the waiter responded.

Reactions are always instinctive whereas responses are always well thought of.

A beautiful way to understand............LIFE.

Person who is HAPPY is not because Everything is RIGHT in his Life..

He is HAPPY because his Attitude towards Everything in his Life is Right..!!,,,,,,,

Anita:
"Hi! I'm a lady aged 26 married with one kid. Last week my husband was off duty and I had to drive alone to work. I left my husband with the maid and my baby at home. I drove for just about 2km from home n my car engine started to overheat so I turned back to get  the other car. When i got home i found my husband in bed with our maid!!! I don't know what to do now. Please help." 

Reply by male columnist:

"Dear Anita, 
Overheating of engine after such short distance can be caused by problems associated with the carburetor. You need to check your oil and water level in your engine before you start your journey. You must also make sure your car is serviced regularly to avoid problems in future. Hope this helps."

A wealthy manager was driving in his car when he saw two men along the roadside eating grass. Disturbed by the sight, he ordered his driver to stop and he got out to investigate. He asked one man "Why are you eating grass?"

"We don't have any money for food," the poor man replied. "We have to eat grass." "Well, then, you can come with me to my house and I'll feed you" the manager said.

"But sir, I have a wife and five children with me. They are over there, under that tree".

"Bring them along," the manager replied. Turning to the other poor man he stated, "You come with us also."

The second man, in a pitiful voice then said, "But sir, I also have a wife and seven children with me!"

"Bring them all, as well," the manager answered.
They all entered the car, which was no easy task, even for a car as large as it was. 

One of the poor fellows turned to mr. Manager and said, "Sir, you are too kind. Thank you for taking all of us with you."

The manager replied, "Glad to do it. You'll really love my place; the grass is almost 1 meter high!" 

Lesson: Never trust managers... They will take u to any extreme to finish their job. 

And there is nothing like KIND MANAGERS 😜

[29/06/15, 10:12:51 PM] Vikram: Could not resist sending this........

Early one morning a mother went to her sleeping son and woke him up, “Wake up, son. It’s time to go to school.”

SON : “Awww Mom! I don’t want to go to school.”

MOM : “Give me two reasons why you don’t want to go to school.”

SON : 
“One, all the children hate me. 
Two, all the teachers hate me.”

MOM : “Oh! that’s not a reason. Come on, you have to go to school.”

SON : “ OK. You give me two good reasons WHY I should go to school?”

MOM : 

One,
you are FIFTY-TWO years old,
And should understand your responsibilities. 

Two.....





You are the PRINCIPAL of the school "😂😄😁😜
[30/06/15, 10:07:11 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Neil Armstrong, he is the 1st person to set his foot in moon.

But, do you know who was supposed to be the 1st person?  Many don't know...

His name is Edwin C Aldarin...
He was the pilot for the Apollo mission. He was working for the American Airforce. Moreover he had experience of space walking, hence selected as the pilot.

Neil Armstrong worked for the American Navy. He was selected for his courage as co-pilot. 

When the Apollo mission landed on moon, they received a command from NASA, "pilot first".

But Aldarin was hesitant, "what will happen", "will I get sucked in or will I burn out", etc. The hesitation was not for hours, but few seconds. 

In the meantime, NASA sent the next command, "co-pilot next".

Within next second, Neil Armstrong put his foot on the moon & became part of world history. 

World history was changed in 1 second... Though Aldarin had the qualification and talent, because of hesitation, he is not recognised by many people. 

The world remembers only person who comes first...
This is a good example of how people lose out because of hesitation & fear. Whenever you see the moon, remember this, a moments hesitation can stop us from our greatest victory. 

We all have great potential in us, the only thing that stops us from achieving what we are supposed to achieve is our hesitation, fear and shyness. 

Many people are shy to ask, shy to appreciate others, & some are shy to share this message. If we fail to do the right things, we will most likely do the wrong things.

Hence share the good messages. Avoid hesitation. 😊

Absolute Classic!!!
An attractive young woman on a flight from Ireland asked the Priest beside her, 'Father, may I ask a favor ?

'Of course child. What may I do for you?'

'Well, I bought my mother an expensive hair dryer for her birthday. It is unopened but well over the Customs limits and I am afraid they will confiscate it. Is there any way you could carry it through customs for me? Hide it under your robes perhaps ? 

'I would love to help you, dear, but I must warn you, I will not lie.'

"With your  face, Father, no one will question you"

When they got to Customs, she let the priest go first. The official asked,
"Father, do you have anything to declare?"

"From the top of my head down to my waist, I have nothing to declare.."

The official thought this answer strange, so asked,"And what do you have to declare from your waist to the floor?"

"I have a marvelous Instrument designed to be used on a woman,
but which is, to date, unused.."

Roaring with laughter, the official said, 'Go ahead, Father.
Next Pls

[23/07/15, 1:54:00 AM] Sandeep Vallapu: I liked this msg .. Felt like sharing 😊

Are we earning to pay builders and interior designers, caterers and decorators?  

Whom do we want to impress with our highly inflated house properties & fat weddings?

Do you remember for more than two days what you ate at someone's marriage? 

Why are we working like dogs in our prime years of life?

How many generations do we want to feed?

Most of us have two kids. Many have a single kid. 

How much is the "need" and how much do we actually "want"?? 
Think about it.

Would our next generation be incapable to earn, that we save so much for them!?!

Can not we spare one and a half days a week for friends, family and self??

Do you spend even 5% of your monthly income for your self enjoyment? 
Usually...No.

Why can't we enjoy simultaneously while we earn?   

Spare time to enjoy before you have slipped discs and large prostates.

We don't own properties, we just have temporary name on documents.

GOD laughs sarcastically, when someone says,
"I am the owner of this land"!!    

Do not judge a person only by the length of his car. 

Many of our science and maths teachers were great personalities riding on scooters!!    

It is not bad to be rich, but it is very unfair, to be only rich.

Let's get a LIFE, before life gets us, instead....

[18/08/15, 9:26:41 PM] Suhail Ambrose: Masterpiece on Economics :-

One day a tourist comes to the only hotel in a debt ridden town in Kenya. He lays a 100 dollar note on the table & goes to inspect the rooms.

Hotel owner takes the note & rushes to pay his debt to the butcher.

Butcher runs to pay the poultry farmer.

Poultry farmer runs to pay the feed supplier.

Supplier runs to pay the maid, who in these hard times gave her services on credit.

Maid then runs to pay off her debt to the hotel owner whom she borrowed from in these hard times.

Hotel owner then lays the 100 dollar note back on the counter.

The tourist comes down, takes his money & leaves as he did not like the rooms.

No one earned anything. But that group of people is now without debt & looks to the future with a lot of optimism.
And that is how the world is doing business today!

Worth a read..!!!

[12/09/15, 10:51:02 PM] Subba Rao BVB: Six golden rules for f***ing:

1. F***ing once a week
is good for your health but harmful if done every day.

2. F***ing gives proper relaxation for your mind
and body.

3. F***ing refreshes you.

4. After f***ing don't eat too much; go for more liquids.

5. When f***ing try to stay in bed because it can save you valuable energy.

6. F***ing can even reduce your cholesterol level

SO REMEMBER - *FASTING* is good for your health - may the Almighty cleanse your dirty mind! ✋😂

The airline has bungled and the crew are in a fix. However, one smart flight attendant has a good idea.  About 30 minutes into the flight, she nervously announces ...."I don't know how this happened but we have 103 passengers and only 40 dinners..."

When the passengers muttering died down she continued. .."Anyone who is kind enough to give up his/her meal so that someone else can eat, will receive free and unlimited liquor 🍺🍻 throughout  the flight duration."

Her next announcement came an hour and a half later. .."If anyone wants to change his/her mind we still have 40 dinners available...."

RBI...RBI...RBI...RBI......RECENT RBI POLICY explained in very simple way...
RBI...RBI...RBI...RBI.

👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌


Santa: I have heard recently that Mr. Rajan has reduced Repo Rate by 50 basis points and everyone is saying that this is good for the market. Loan EMI may also come down. What is this rate cut means actually? I want to understand this. 

Banta: To understand this you first need to know, how does a bank function. 

Santa: Why? 

Banta: Because all these are inter-related. Tell me – what does a bank do? 

Santa: Bank takes money from depositors and gives loan to earn interest. That way they keep everyone happy and make a profit also. 

Banta: Correct, but there are more to it. Let me explain this in a very simplistic way. Bank needs money. Bank can get money from depositors like you and me and also from RBI. But bank also needs to pay certain interest to us and also to RBI. 

Santa: Ok. 

Banta: Let us try to understand first – what happens when we deposit, say, Rs. 100 with a bank. 

Santa: I know that. Bank gives that Rs. 100 to someone who needs a loan. 

Banta: No, it is not that simple. Remember, though bank can earn interest by giving away loans, but it is also very risky. There are many cases of loan defaults. This way banks can put all our money into high risk areas. It has to be protected. 

Santa: How? 

Banta: Ok, RBI has made it mandatory that upon receiving, say, Rs. 100 – banks first have to deposit Rs. 4 with RBI. RBI keeps this Rs. 4 in its current a/c and hence banks do not receive any interest on this money. This is known as Cash Reserve Ratio or CRR, which is currently at 4%. 

Santa: Hmmm, then? 

Banta: RBI has also made it mandatory that upon receiving, say, Rs. 100 – banks need to compulsorily buy central and state govt. securities of Rs. 21.50. Of course banks will earn some interest income here. This is known as Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR), which is currently at 21.50%. 

Santa: Ok, so you mean to say that upon receiving Rs. 100, banks can spend only Rs. 74.50 at its own will. 

Banta: Correct. 100 – (4 + 21.50) = 100 – 25.50 = 74.50 

Santa: But you were saying that banks can also borrow from RBI. What interest banks pay to RBI? 

Banta: Before 30th September, banks were paying 8.25% interest to RBI when it borrows money from RBI. Now this rate has been reduced by 50 basis points. So banks now need to pay interest to RBI, if it borrows from RBI, at the rate of 7.75%. This is known as Repo Rate. 

Santa: Can fixed deposit rate be affected by reduction of Repo Rate? 

Banta: Of course. If banks get money from RBI @7.75%, why will banks pay higher interest to you and me? One year FD rate is already revised by many banks and it is equal to or very close to 7.75%. 

Santa: But as now banks are getting money at a cheaper rate, then they should reduce the loan interest rate i.e. passing on the benefits it receives. 

Banta: Correct. They should. And on that hope market is cheering. If companies get loan at a cheaper rate, they will likely to expand their businesses. That will create more jobs, more income and boost the economy. 

Santa: How is inflation linked to this? 

Banta: See, when loan becomes cheaper, people tends to borrow more. That means people will have more money to spend. This will increase the demand for goods, and if supply does not increase to match this demand, then prices will increase. 

Santa: So there is a chance, that inflation may rise also? 

Banta: Well, yes. But inflation depends on many other factors as well, like production (industrial and agricultural), manufacturing, export – import, foreign currency movement etc. So inflation may increase or may not. 

Santa: One last question. Like we deposit our money with banks, can banks also deposit their money with someone? 

Banta: Yes, they can deposit with RBI and earn interest too. This interest is typically 1% less than the repo rate. This rate is known as Reverse Repo Rate. 

Santa: Great! So now I understand CRR, SLR, Repo Rate, Reverse Repo Rate and their impact on deposit rate, loan interest rate and on inflation. Thanks. 

Banta: Welcome!

[29/10/15, 12:33:52 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: "Breaking" News- White colour Hyundai car owned by Hemanth Kumar, a resident of NIRD campus, Rajendranagar, Hyderabad hit a 49Kg wild Pig at 1049am on Thursday. While the pig has meagrely lost some of its hair, the car sustained a dent and the number plate has been broken beyond recognition. The left fog lamps has been found to be re-oriented. This follows a spate of similar incidents in the past, which involved cracking of fuel pipe, breaking of forward bumper,cracking of forward windshield,breaking of right view mirror to quote a few. In a press statement the owner of the car cited mis-alignment in planetary position as the reason for repeated mishaps. An expert team headed by NIRD youth club president N Sravan Kumar has been formed to look in to institution of remedial measures. The team is expected to  carry out a thorough Forensic Investigation in to the planetary motions and Astrodymanics in close coordination with the scientists of ISRO and NASA, which led to the mishaps and submit a report in a months time.

[29/10/15, 1:45:33 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: Mr. President, as your principle advisor I suggest you order hunting down of all pigs and then celebrating annual pork barbecue party rather than spending money on re alignment. This will make your people happy and also solve the issue.

[11/11/15, 4:05:24 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Must Read: Hyderabad Diary,Fallacy of School Friends-  Everyone wants to succeed and do well in life. It takes lot of effort to get there and Its every successful individual's common minimum expectation to be respected,acknowledged and views respected is an individual's natural requirement in social circles. Friends form a very essential part of it. Although friends at work, collage etc. mostly interact within the realm of above expectations mainly because of their proximity of witness to ones journey to success and struggles; be it academic or professional or otherwise. However, school friends, more often than not tend to have a slightly more if it may called, an edgy relationship among one another. Following are some of the possible reasons:- (a) No awareness of each other's struggles to success (b) Lack of understanding of each other's capabilities (Professional or otherwise) (c) Nature of friendship based more on Habitual relationships that existed in school days (d) Non acknowledgement of each other's changed social ego states by the virtue of their progress. The last point Ser(d) is the most important of all. The biggest disadvantage in one sense the school friends have is their "knowledge of each other's personal attributes". Such a knowledge will make it difficult to view each another from a prism of prejudice than anything else unless mature enough. The "growth" of a person both as an "Individual" and "Intellectual" tend to be ignored among school friends. Another aspect is respecting each other's personal sphere of lives and insulating them from interactions among school friends unless a desired level of maturity is reached. If the above are not taken care of, following are the possible fallouts:- (a) Level of interactions will be at a primitive level (b) Ridiculing each other's attributes (c) Disregard to each other's sensitivities. More often then not such outcomes can only arise due to two reasons, namely (a) Deep rooted inferiority complex (b) Sense of Pride. As my leave is coming to an end and I will be flying back to Delhi, I thought it was my duty to point out things said above, unequivocally, as I have observed interacting during the course of these 19days. I felt a need to point out things mainly because I got a feeling that more than 50% of this group members do not share a healthy relationship among one another,no matter how prompt one is on this platform. Most of them "Jhelte hai" just because they have known the other for a while. The reason I felt was as simple as this "Lack of respect for each other". Iam not sure as to how many of you would agree with all that I have said above, nor was is my intention to convince, however if at all if anyone feels there is any sense in that has been said, my request would be to kindly make necessary amends because "People" are Valuable, Happy Diwali:-))

[12/11/15, 2:55:17 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Comments please
[12/11/15, 3:47:22 PM] Vikram: Hemanth, let me first tell you, i did not read your long message till few hours back. Since it was too long and it started with “must read” and ended with “happy Diwali”; I assumed it to be a forward. When you wrote the whole message was the intent to keep up with friends and clear differences or to ridicule a few friends in a group? I do not understand a lot of your content and context. I am also not sure, what is directed at me or was there something for me? Whatsoever, the message is offensive to whom so ever it was directed. To answer your bigger question, everyone would stand by one another in the times needed and wise versa. 100% of us share a very healthy relation. Just because we make fun of someone, it doesn’t mean we are ridiculing; Don’t expect friends to salute each other. We all understand each other’s bag rounds, strengths, weaknesses, potential, capabilities, in capabilities yet we are friends. Now, what I expect from you is to get it straight and clear this with whomsoever if you have an issue with. And stop beating around the bush and lecturing.
[12/11/15, 4:00:52 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Malli neeku kuda jai telangana and cheers 🍻
[12/11/15, 4:24:45 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Firstly,Thanks for reading the message. And thank you for posting your opinion on this forum
[12/11/15, 4:24:51 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: I appreciate it
[12/11/15, 4:24:59 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Now coming to the point
[12/11/15, 4:25:18 PM] Suhail Ambrose: I 100 % echo with what vikram said..in fact. .from the discussion I had with you today..it is learnt that it is neither for me..never the less..it would take it up on the most audacious way to condemn your openion about the once based out in hyd.  How dare you use words like "jealous" inferiority complex" " redecule" disrespect and so on on us? This was the first time such feelings and sentiments are discussed amongst us. I strongly feel all the once here are 3am friends..no matter we insult, reducle, make fun, I know when I call any random person any time, they would be there for me( of course that doesn't mean that we take insults and redecule on a lighter note) if intensional I did hurt any one , I am truly apologetic, and this goes to every one on this group.
We have an awesome friendship, we wait for our parents to go out of town so that we can hang out all night, and we have quality and dearly time..we go to friends functions even without invitations..we attend friends children's birthdays even though we dint speak them for ages..that says it all.
 We all know each other v well and the backgrounds..struggles and so on..you don't have to remind us to respect whome and salute whome. 
I personally feel, you are being ungrateful, have u forgotten the days we used to stand near nird gate when you used to come back for vacation..we used to consider your vacation plans before we planned our trips to goa which never happened.
It is saddening to hear  your perspective and how you feel we are having an unhealthy friendship.
And hemant, I am warning you, dare you try to impose your openion and make words like jelousy, Insult and redecule a common phrase in our friendship.
 I can't believe it hemant,  did you call school friends a fallacy! Do you know the meaning of it..it means " a mistaken belief"
I am offended..we are 30 now and this is how you you see chaddibuddies?
I have begun to question You use vocabulary for fancy or meaning!
You are not here dude..we have celebrated every promotion,  new job, child birth, and any good happening royally ! You missed it all..so don't say (a) no awareness of each others struggle or success. We have searched jobs for job less friends and tried to show them every avenue possible..(b) friendship based on habitual relationships..where the fuck do you get such phrases from!
No acknowledgement of social change..you want us to keep parsing the person who is doing exceptionally well, what about the person whome luck is not favouring, do we redecule him? Grow up dude..need to balance out and act appropriately.
Inferiority complex! !! Sense of pride!!!  
I am sorry Hemant., I am disturbed, dint see this coming from you
[12/11/15, 4:26:34 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Thank you for having the patience to go through and expressing your views I
[12/11/15, 4:27:30 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Coming to the topic at hand, now that you guys have commented on it let me get thread bare now
[12/11/15, 4:31:28 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: There are three things that my observations are based on 1) Making fun(according to some) 2) Respecting others 3)Loose talk
[12/11/15, 4:32:06 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Now before I go further do I have permission of Vikram and Suhail to quote instances that I was effected?
[12/11/15, 4:32:36 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: After that Srikanth and Sravan may do that without fear of anyone
[12/11/15, 4:34:02 PM] Suhail Ambrose: Not in this forum! Don't make personal issues public..we will take it up hemant. .you are worsening things big time. I condemn your approach redeculously!
[12/11/15, 4:34:26 PM] Suhail Ambrose: And would least want you to me a mediator!

[12/11/15, 4:34:54 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: When you insult you do it publicly right, why are you scared of getting exposed publicly after giving such a nice lecture on public morality and ethics
[12/11/15, 4:35:11 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: So jai telangana
[12/11/15, 4:35:19 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: I think same is applicable to Vikram
[12/11/15, 4:35:20 PM] Vikram: What are you talking about? What instances? I can rip your ass for being an complete asshole in many instances
[12/11/15, 4:35:53 PM] Vikram: There are few things I cannot talk in public
[12/11/15, 4:35:59 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: For example?
[12/11/15, 4:36:28 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: No please go ahead,I have no shame in admitting if Iam wrong
[12/11/15, 4:36:29 PM] Suhail Ambrose: I am not getting though you hemant! Donot dare spoil our friendship..you have created enough bitterness by using inappropriate vocabulary already
[12/11/15, 4:37:35 PM] Vikram: Shut the fuck up Hemanth
[12/11/15, 4:37:46 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: I stand by eveything that has been said. I fail to understand why is it only effecting Vikram and Suhail of all

Don't make this group more obnoxious
[12/11/15, 5:10:43 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: U have hurt enough people Suhail. Group is just an online platform. Regard should come from hearts.
[12/11/15, 5:11:09 PM] Suhail Ambrose: In your dreams

[12/11/15, 5:15:21 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Not Sandy and Subbarao
[12/11/15, 5:15:26 PM] Suhail Ambrose: That means you stand a trial and you know it
[12/11/15, 5:15:43 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: What?

[12/11/15, 5:17:09 PM] Abhijeet Singh Rathod: Guys stop it n clear all this shit in person rather making it public
[12/11/15, 5:17:09 PM] Abhijeet Singh Rathod: We know there have been some differences but making it public would just make it worse n nothing else
[12/11/15, 5:19:03 PM] Suhail Ambrose: My pvt chat is awaiting hemanths response..but he just doesn't respond pvt
[12/11/15, 5:19:40 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Dude y r u so ashamed to wash ur dirty Lenin in public?

[12/11/15, 5:21:49 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: ‎Suhail Ambrose removed Hemanth Yeddula
[12/11/15, 5:22:07 PM] Abhijeet Singh Rathod: I don't know what you went wrong between you all its better if you clear it offline
[12/11/15, 5:22:41 PM] Suhail Ambrose: Sorry guys..I threw him out. Now this is what I call dealing with intolerance.
[12/11/15, 5:23:41 PM] Chaddi Buddies: ‎You're now an admin
[12/11/15, 5:38:24 PM] Avinash Rajendran: What happened to Hemanth...
[12/11/15, 5:38:52 PM] Suhail Ambrose: Sulking
[12/11/15, 5:40:06 PM] Avinash Rajendran: Strange...at this age and time(actually lack of it) doesnt quite add up
[12/11/15, 5:40:30 PM] Suhail Ambrose: I don't want to discuss him in his absence .that wouldn't be fair
[12/11/15, 5:41:09 PM] Avinash Rajendran: Fair enough...
[12/11/15, 5:41:59 PM] Avinash Rajendran: Jai Telengana Shravan... End of discussion.
[12/11/15, 6:01:40 PM] ~ 🤔: Suhail wasn't fair to remove him though...everyone has a freedom to speak in this group I guess .... Leaves a bad taste but I guess it would have put his mind to rest..being friends means to speak out loud without afraid of consequences....
[12/11/15, 6:03:14 PM] Abhijeet Singh Rathod: Agreed 👍
[12/11/15, 6:11:32 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: This is not fair and lovely  😜

[12/11/15, 6:16:03 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Jai telangana
[12/11/15, 6:18:30 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Thanks guys for putting me back in after I have been kicked out
[12/11/15, 6:20:13 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Is it a big thing to ask not to Ridicule on the name of fun
[12/11/15, 6:21:07 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Is it so difficult to take the effort and extra mile to know the other persons sensitivities and try not to hurt?
[12/11/15, 6:24:16 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: And then when I say this, Iam lecturing and preaching
[12/11/15, 6:24:39 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: And then Iam kicked out
[12/11/15, 6:25:30 PM] Suhail Ambrose: Hemanth..if you have issues with pearl heights..pls come here and sort it out..or we will come Tom and talk. .don't make a hue and cry of it here
[12/11/15, 6:26:00 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: See the arrogance in your tone

[12/11/15, 6:29:26 PM] Avinash Rajendran: What ever ur claiming may be a gossip but i am sure none of our frnds are scheming against any one so calm down and lay the issue to rest...
[12/11/15, 6:31:14 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: @ Aviansh...See there is no smoke with out fire...Anyways, u have a point.

[12/11/15, 6:35:00 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Anyway I'll shut up now rather than again being unceremoniously get kicked out

"Racism will never end as long as white cars are still using black tyres. Racism will never end if people still use black to symbolise bad luck and white for peace. Racism will never end if people still wear white clothes to weddings and black clothes to funerals. Racism will never end as long as those who don't pay their bills are blacklisted not whitelisted. Even when playing snooker. You haven't won until you've sunk the black ball, and the white ball must remain on the table. But I don't care, as long as I'm still using white toilet paper to wipe my black butt , I'm fine!"..

[04/12/15, 6:47:00 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: Our intelligent kejri govt to allow cars with even numbers and odd numbers on alternate days in Delhi to beat pollution
[04/12/15, 6:48:37 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: Something tried in Beijing and didn't seem to help much
[04/12/15, 6:51:10 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Well with 331 Toxity index and National Green Tribunal already calling Delhi as a Gas Chamber, Iam wondering why is it that car sales are stopped right now. Beijing has done exactly the same thing in 2013. Before saying Singapore and China are flourishing the way they are, one needs to understand why they are. Strict enforcement and discipline is an essential feature. Well I think today in Delhi a little inconvenience to think for 2min is better than not being able to breath
[04/12/15, 6:51:20 PM] Avinash Rajendran: Its not kejri's fault...its the fault of all those idiots who voted him to power the second time around
[04/12/15, 6:51:33 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: No I disagree
[04/12/15, 6:51:50 PM] Avinash Rajendran: Did he respond to ur letter
[04/12/15, 6:52:00 PM] Avinash Rajendran: The one u posted
[04/12/15, 6:52:12 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Drastic steps needed and it's being done. What has been done for so many years?
[04/12/15, 6:52:22 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Can some one please list down?
[04/12/15, 6:52:26 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: It didn't do well in China Or Singapore.
[04/12/15, 6:53:25 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Well then let's wait and be patient if it works in Delhi. How can one come to conclusion without the experiment results being out
[04/12/15, 6:53:32 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: It's better to take all those vehicles off road which are 10 years or older. Any old vehicle to stay on road needs to pass pollution test!
[04/12/15, 6:53:51 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: That was done.
[04/12/15, 6:54:08 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: They are also shutting down the thermal plant in Badarpur
[04/12/15, 6:54:15 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: FYI
[04/12/15, 6:54:36 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Open garbage burning is banned in Delhi
[04/12/15, 6:54:43 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Environmental tax gone up
[04/12/15, 6:54:52 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Trucks allowed only after 11pm
[04/12/15, 6:55:00 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: All done by the same govt
[04/12/15, 6:55:03 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: You have a point there .... Let's not arrive at conclusion. Let's wait and see
[04/12/15, 6:55:17 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Absolutely.
[04/12/15, 6:56:14 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Iam sure the state cabinet and the officers wouldn't have done it without thinking it through. Nevertheless we should wait and see before making foregone conclusions
[04/12/15, 6:56:18 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: 🙏
[04/12/15, 6:57:42 PM] Vikram: I'm just wondering what would have modi or congress done if they were in power?!
[04/12/15, 6:59:21 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: Any body would have acted because they and their families live there
[04/12/15, 6:59:58 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Anybody would have acted? Please tell me who acted and what was done
[04/12/15, 7:00:15 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Except talking about it in occasional environmental forums
[04/12/15, 7:00:21 PM] Vikram: Hence stop criticizing aap at every scheme they introduce
[04/12/15, 7:00:56 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: I said let time decide the fate of aap
[04/12/15, 7:01:42 PM] Vikram: You said it failed in Beijing
[04/12/15, 7:02:05 PM] Vikram: Well the bigger point is, give it a chance with open arms
[04/12/15, 7:03:34 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: I said that loud and clear. I can't argue with those who have already made up their mind. If you see the conversation I said "let time decide" because I did not make up my mind.
[04/12/15, 7:05:18 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: The comment opened with "Our intelligent"..on a sarcasm and prejudice that anything he does is knee jerk and wrong.
[04/12/15, 7:06:02 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: The "let me decide" course was picked up midway
[04/12/15, 7:06:13 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Request scroll back
[04/12/15, 7:27:47 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: @avinash...It will only be an adventurism on my part of I expect the CM to respond to my letter.It's practically impossible to do it and that's not the intention either. The letter was written in order to bring an important civic issue to his notice. The letter would have reached the desk of the Principal secy and then would have been marked to the North Delhi Municipal corporation, which would have comfortable put it in dust bin(Since they are from another party). They only way Govt of Delhi can get it done is through PWD. So that shows the plight of Delhi Govt which they have been crying to deaf ears. In any state,The tools that a CM has are Police(for law enforcement) and Municipal Corporation(Maintaining civic sense). Now in Delhi both are under the Central Govt.
[04/12/15, 7:29:38 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: That's what I feel about him but you gave your reason then I said let's wait and see
[04/12/15, 7:30:18 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Fair enough.
[04/12/15, 7:47:35 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: @Srikanth And look at the media bias..Times Now especially. They say AAP MLAs pay hiked by 400%, which is essentially from 14k to 50k. I don't know how many of us will work for 14K, and an "Honest" MLA cannot survive on 14K, simple. Iam amazed why are focussing on "400%" rather than "14k pay". Well FYI as per 7th pay commission recommendations that is the lowest pay of a Central Govt employee.
[04/12/15, 7:51:40 PM] Avinash Rajendran: People don't remember how many kids they have in Delhi. How the hell will they think which car even or odd to take
[04/12/15, 7:56:57 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: Hike thing is fine
[04/12/15, 7:56:57 PM] Avinash Rajendran: Wrt the pay I agree...and I seem to digest the fact that yes atleast some of is trying...
[04/12/15, 7:57:16 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: But already friends are grouping to exchange number plates
[04/12/15, 7:57:18 PM] Avinash Rajendran: I guess like u said above time will tell
[04/12/15, 7:57:53 PM] Avinash Rajendran: And how would the police chk even odd no. Plates
[04/12/15, 7:58:08 PM] Avinash Rajendran: How do u cater for emergency
[04/12/15, 7:58:37 PM] Avinash Rajendran: How does one cater for vehicles from other states..like people on visit
[04/12/15, 8:06:33 PM] Vikram: The odd number even number is only for commercial vehicles and not for private. If people are changing number plates, they will face the consequences
[04/12/15, 8:06:37 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: @avi and Sri. I totally agree that implementation have its challenges. That's exactly the Chief Secy K K Sharma has told. The execution plan is being worked on. What Iam pointing out is in Delhi we need strong(may be unpopular) measures to curb pollution. People will have to accept some inconvenience of not for the sake of themselves but atleast for the future of their children who go to school early in the morning. Today i had to drive on fog lamps, when there is no "Fog" it is "Smog". Think blanket of smoke
[04/12/15, 8:08:22 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: I challenge anyone who can take a walk near AIIMS flyover for 10min without finding thick layer of slag on skin. If that is the state near a hospital
[04/12/15, 8:08:39 PM] Avinash Rajendran: 👌🏽
[04/12/15, 8:08:44 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Then forget industrial areas like Okhla etc
[04/12/15, 8:17:16 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: And what is such a big deal in knowing to use a car of odd number number on a odd date and even date. Initial friction is understandable, later people will get used to it(including me). Iam sure one who knows how to drive a car will have an IQ to know this much. When we can get used to voting for corrupt inspite of knowing they are, why not get used to something that reduces carbon foot print. Okay, if not for Kejriwal people should do it voluntarily for the sake of delhis future.

All the men got up. "No, I meant who has seen a cock?"... All the women got up. "No, No, Who has seen a cock that isn't their's?"... Half the women got up. "Oh, for Heaven's sake, Who has seen my cock?"... All the nuns got up...and the priest fainted...!!!

[10/12/15, 6:09:26 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Salman Khan acquitted by Delhi HC. So following is the procedure to be adopted if you find yourself in a Criminal litigation 1) Don't Panic 2) Bribe Policeman, he will generally manage the prosecution lawyer because it's a standard operating procedure 3) Once you managed Police and Prosecution you can save money for your lawyer(Why do you need a Ram Jethmalani if the other party dosent put up a strong case in the first place)! Simple, you are free to go. There's hardly anything a Judge can do. Moral of the story - Justice is not only blind but costly!
[10/12/15, 6:17:20 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: There is an element of truth when people say crime and criminals happen mostly in the lower strata of the society. That is because they don't have money to manage the system so they get convicted most of the times, while the big boys manage the system and escape. I think the amount of crime is same both is upper and well as lower strata. It is only in the nature of crime(White coller-big boys and Black coller- small fries) and rate of conviction that differs.

[15/12/15, 10:11:33 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Arnab Goswami’s father Col. (Retd.) Manoranjan Goswami contested as a BJP candidate in the Indian general election,from Guwahati.
[15/12/15, 10:35:01 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Off all the 40 accusations above, none can be called a substantial allegation with a proof(media reports alone arent a proof, it can only be used as a supporting proof as per the evidence act) a gossip. The only serial that deserves some merit is Ser 1, but strangely enough in the video one can only hear the voice but the person is not visible in the most important part of the so called "fixing". It's a classic case of forensic editing
[16/12/15, 12:19:31 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: Ignore corruption charges on rajendra Kumar, support corrupted alliance in Bihar,  shout in front of media when CBI raid corrupted official.... And he is anti corruption crusader...kejriwal rocks ;)
[16/12/15, 1:37:19 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: He seems to be anti modi and not anti corruption. A person who lost his direction. I'm not modi Bhakt but I surely don't trust kejri. He is not a leader material.
[16/12/15, 2:22:03 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Jai telangana

[16/12/15, 2:22:13 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Entra mee lolli
[16/12/15, 2:51:08 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: 1) He never shouted infront of media for raiding on his PS. He shouted because a) The CM was not intimated about the raid(Surprise element involved in being sold be BJP and CBI dosent hold any merit since the case pertains to 2007-2014 of congress govt and the present govt is obviously not an affected party even if it was raided where is the element of surprise in the raid). b) They are not allowing CM to use his office and checking all the files(which is not their jurisdiction),You have to restrict yourself to files that are needed-That's the standard procedure in govt office. Even in my office we have regular queues by CAG, CBI etc. I don't give them the keys of the cupboard and tell them to search eveything they like. c)There is a lot of suspicion in the way it was conducted, mainly DDCA file
[16/12/15, 2:53:33 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Coming to Nitish and TMC- It's a strategic move to garner support in parliament for the demand of full statehood. Arithmetic is simple majority is needed to pass a bill for grant of statehood, he is trying to do that as a long term strategy. It's a sign of political strategy.
[16/12/15, 2:56:16 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: All your observations are opinions. Counter his policies on merits and technicalities rather then media gossips and prejudices. That will be an intellectually stimulating as well as informative debate.
[16/12/15, 2:57:04 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Entraa me lolli
[16/12/15, 3:08:03 PM] Abhijeet Singh Rathod: Shravan villani ee NDTV oo leda CNN news channel lo recruit chesayali full too TRP vastundi
[16/12/15, 3:10:35 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Adey kada
[16/12/15, 3:12:33 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: By the way, an IAS officer is posted by Central govt by DOPT(Dept of personnel and training) who is the cadre controlling authority for All India services. In delhis case if you remember, when the govt was newly formed AAP proposed an Arunachal cadre officer, but the govt never agreed to it saying there are many other senior people available. Then they put Shakuntala Gamlin who AAP dint agree. Finally KK Sharma was appointed as the Chief secy by the Central Govt under the signature of LG. Similarly a Principal secretaries appointment is also done by LG on the recommendation of the Union Government, and not by CM. That too mainly in Delhi where Central govt quotes Art 239A of constitution in which LG is being claimed to be he Head of the Govt(which is a erroneous interpretation), so if it is so in all issues, let LG be held accountable, after all he is the head right
[16/12/15, 3:12:53 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Jai telangana 💪
[16/12/15, 3:14:55 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: From above example it is clear to Any laymen that, Central Govt and LG invoke their constitutional positions to interfere in the governance and palm off when it comes to taking responsibility
[16/12/15, 3:16:28 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: So basically they need "Full power with no accountability or responsibility". While Kejriwal is answerable to the people of Delhi, they keep interfering to bring down efficiently. That's their strategy. Simple

[17/12/15, 7:24:04 AM] Hemanth Yeddula: Very well thought and articulated..must read
[17/12/15, 7:24:55 AM] Hemanth Yeddula: Mainly the "analysis" part of it
[17/12/15, 8:53:01 AM] Subba Rao BVB: "Two years and 10 months ago in-front of his eyes his girlfriend was brutally raped by six bastards in a running bus of Delhi.

He fought till the time he was beaten blue with an iron rod.

They broke his leg, robbed him, snatched his mobile & left him almost naked..

He fought till the time he could. Then on that chilling cold night he was thrown from the running bus along with his girl friend.

They were naked, drained, exhausted & both were bleeding for different reasons.

He tried to stop passing cars & kept on begging for a piece of shawl to wrap his naked girl friend & finally he got it after 40 minutes.

Then he took her to the hospital, admitted her, called the police,called her parents & did every possible co-operation that a true friend should do in the hour of need.


He could have fled from the bus - he did not. 

He could have left her on the road - he did not. 

He could have claimed fame & money ( as the father of Nirbhaya who took Rs 25 lakhs from UP CM, a job for his son & many more from many people in his daughter's name ) - but he did not. 

He could have claimed his treatment money from Govt - he did not. 

He could have become the most frequently seen face in the electronic media in exchange of money - he did not.


If this is not friendship then what is friendship??


When the entire country roared for the girl no one thought what this boy had gone through that night.

He is not a film star or a cricketer.

He is Awindra Pratap Pandey, a boy from Gorakshapur in UP, the boy who loved his girl from the core of his heart.

When this boy is there somewhere in anonymity, why we Indians should celebrate Friendship Day on 3rd August to copy the Americans??

We should celebrate Friendship Day in India  on 16th December to salute the spirit of Awindra who proved what friendship means.


Let 16th December be the official Friendship Day in India.


Am I talking sense??

If yes then please share this & give your opinion here.

Make WhatsApp a right platform of social awareness!!

This is a broadcast message

Frwd to all your Frnds."
[17/12/15, 3:04:44 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: I get the larger point the above message is trying to convey. Notwithstanding that, before getting in to the core issue,I take strong objection to one of the paragraphs "He could have claimed fame & money(as the father of Nirbhaya who took Rs 25Lakhs from UP CM etc)", I think pointing out such things is inappropriate and uncalled for, who ever forwarded this msg. I don't think it is right way to look at it.
[17/12/15, 3:06:56 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Let's leave the friendship day part of it as I feel it will be more of symbolic gesture(akin to Nirbhaya fund). It would be most appropriate to rather comment on what needs to be done

Lot needs to be done both on Judicial front(Law,Enforcement & Justice Delivery system). Be that as it may, from a point of view of a common man there are few things that we can do

[17/12/15, 3:36:47 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: I think if one reads the Late Justice Verma Committee report, his suggestions are far reaching and in tune with the society of the day. From the Governments point of View, of all the legislative measures that can be taken the most immediate step to be taken is to have a very robust "Justice Delivery Mechanism" mainly for Rape cases. It includes- Having Fast track courts,increasing number of Judges and Judicial Infrastructure,Having Police stations specifically dealing with sexual crimes,Increasing the number of Forensic laboratories and making them international standards
[17/12/15, 3:38:12 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: The reason why such importance have to be given is it directly deals with the security and well being of 50% of population.
[17/12/15, 3:42:02 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Most important of all "Changing the definition of the word Human Being". It should not only include the physical appearance but also include the acts done. Human Rights have to be applicable to only Human beings. And Meagerly looking like a human should not construe a "Human", but also his acts and conduct should reflect a Human being. This simple looking definition correction can change seal the fate of many offenders and will go a long way in Criminal Jurisprudence in the country.
[17/12/15, 3:42:06 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Yes nird security has become worst sir and online shopping also providing flat 50% discount for Xmas and newyear sir hurry sir

[17/12/15, 10:25:08 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: I don't think anyone of us do vulgar talk about women but sometimes we too slip up when we are in a group in excitement. My limited point is we should try and refrain from doing even that as a matter of principle.

[25/12/15, 2:22:27 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Appreciate PMs surprise decision to land at Pakistan to meet Nawaz Sharif on his Birthday. For the first time in 2years, I've seen "Leadership". This one to one engagement between elected political leadership of both the nations will definitely ruffle Pakistan Army. Not over reading, but Pak leadership should use this to manoeuvre public opinion away from Pak Army and towards political leadership. Good one Modi.👍 Ignore Congress,they are visibly foxed and confused.
[25/12/15, 4:14:54 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Height of Idiocy by Delhi LG. One needs to check the following links to see how dumb can one be by checking these two links one after the other 1) http://toi.in/TRnCZZ 2)https://t.co/slpyb4lF2R?ssr=true
[25/12/15, 4:17:20 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Either he is of the attitude "even though I know It's stupid,let me do something so that centre feels Iam their man" OR "Iam intelligent and that's why Iam LG"😝
[25/12/15, 8:00:07 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: For all the Kejriwal Bashers including Arnab Goswami- If it was Kejriwal who was the PM today and stopped by at Lahore, he would have been called "Knee Jerk", "Krantikari", "Anarchist", "Naxalite" etc. But now it is said "Unconventional diplomacy", "Out of Box", "Masterstroke", "Diplomatic Coup" and what not. And strangely, both Modi as PM and Kejriwal as CM are both first timers.

Yes it would seem a betrayal, but no one else apart from a political leader can stop this blood shed. Iam sure no officer or soldier would like to sit on those Siachen tops at -23 Degrees and Guard at Gun point. Iam sure Adi would agree with me who has been there and done that, I still remember the famous satellite call you made to me from the highest Siachen tops to the farthest seas at Andaman and nicobar😎👍✋

[25/12/15, 11:07:12 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: R u saying anti incumbency and crises are a factor? It's like saying...if you have a good script a good film is automatically made...Someone has to still make it
[25/12/15, 11:08:11 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: Let Punjab come into picture and then see the game ... It's going to be game changer
[25/12/15, 11:11:17 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: AAP has nothing to loose...even if they don't win...it's BJP who will get all the drubbing...UP,West Bengal and Tamil Nadu next up after Punjab. WB & TN is ruled out, Saffron brigade should start Fasting for getting UP. It's definitely going to be a game changer
[25/12/15, 11:15:21 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: I'm not worried much about bjp
[25/12/15, 11:16:01 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: But aap is what I'm concerned about.
[25/12/15, 11:18:59 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Yes we should all be concerned...Rise of AAP(with the same principles) is good for Indian Politics. And if rise of aap triggers mushrooming of similar parties on the same principles, it's a sign of a growing India.
[25/12/15, 11:29:53 PM] ~ 🤔: Hemant I really doubt that ... I hope you do know that the defence intelligence is very apprehensive of aap's rise ... There is quite a substantive amount of proof of them being involved with anti national agencies... And they working on the principle of waiting..
[25/12/15, 11:31:29 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Yes Iam aware of the talk, yet to see the Blue Print.
[25/12/15, 11:33:52 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: The talk need to be substantiated by a credible evident admissible in Courts of India. Be that as it may, it will be in the interest of India and the Ruling Party in particular to "expose" them and bring them to Justice if the "Intelligence" says so!
[25/12/15, 11:35:23 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Evidence*. Anything apart from that is an "optical and acoustic illusion" thrown up to manufacture "opinion" and breed "Judgements"
[25/12/15, 11:41:24 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: This thing has been doing rounds from the time aap came to power in Delhi for the first time. Which defence intelligence? What is the substantial proof? What are the anti national agencies?. If it is so true and credible, what does it take BJP to tell it out? The point is it's all gossip mongering and media guys are waiting in the south block lawns to pick up any crap that flows out from the buildings on Raisina hill
[25/12/15, 11:45:29 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Even A big Audible Fart from Under Rajnath Sings pants...heard by a Journalist in South Block lawns will telecast as a headline "Explosions heard in Home ministry at North Block" 😀 Such is the state of today's media
[25/12/15, 11:55:59 PM] ~ 🤔: I am not speaking from my knowledge off the media 
.. My input comes from else where .. I hold a very impartial view on this .. However ... The thing which was brought to my notice will be detrimental if it comes out in public .... You know there has to be a moderation in how much truth is disclosed... an ideal world where everything is made public will never be successful...
[25/12/15, 11:56:26 PM] ~ 🤔: We will this discussion on that....
[25/12/15, 11:56:47 PM] ~ 🤔: When I come next to Delhi we will talk on this..
[25/12/15, 11:58:03 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Okay fine.
[26/12/15, 12:00:26 AM] Hemanth Yeddula: Notwithstanding,there are procedures available in which business of such nature are transacted b/w executive, judiciary and constitutional bodies like Election Commission of India. That's how all such issues are dealt. Anyways we shall discuss

[26/12/15, 12:03:57 AM] Hemanth Yeddula: But I have a caveat
[26/12/15, 12:06:39 AM] Hemanth Yeddula: There is a Latin Maxim in Criminal Law-"Ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat"-The burden of proof is on the one who declares, not on one who denies
[26/12/15, 12:10:26 AM] ~ 🤔: I agree .. It is the genesis of the fact that accused is not guilty till proven ... But there are things which do not require public trial... There are too many linkages and to many mechanics which are associated with it ... Like a chain reaction .... Nothing is in isolation.... That is y some things are the way gm they are without rain... Respect it.. Live with it....
[26/12/15, 12:11:06 AM] ~ 🤔: And if ever in doubt .... Try and figure out how and why we came into existence...
[26/12/15, 12:11:44 AM] ~ 🤔: It will help in attaining closure for why somethings are left unexplained....
[26/12/15, 12:16:34 AM] ~ 🤔: Chal bro ... Have got an early morning tomorrow ... Will catch later on this...
[26/12/15, 12:18:40 AM] Hemanth Yeddula: Just for the sake of an academic argument, even assuming the existence of such events, to my mind i find it impossible to declare Criminalality without no clear overt act being absolutely attributed to an accused. It's not me, that's the Law of the Land. There is no liability
[26/12/15, 12:18:51 AM] Hemanth Yeddula: Ok Gudnyt. Long weekend u c

[26/12/15, 8:08:10 AM] ~ Srikanth Palle: I second with Aditya. My reference is not from anti national activities but just the way party is functioning. What they talk and what they do? How they think? It seems so foolish at times. 
Most important thing when I talk against aap doesn't mean I support bjp or any other party.
[26/12/15, 9:27:54 AM] Hemanth Yeddula: 😂😂😂👌
[26/12/15, 9:29:08 AM] Avinash Rajendran: Sorry i did it without the permission of the admin but.... I guess.....
[26/12/15, 9:36:41 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: 👍👌
[26/12/15, 9:42:19 AM] ~ 🤔: 👍🏼👍🏼😂😂
[26/12/15, 9:43:53 AM] Hemanth Yeddula: It's unfair to interpret every act of theirs is being immature. Classic example- Odd even plan, the day it was announced it was ridiculed without even having the patience to wait for the ble print. I think everyone got so used to indecisiveness and conventional way of executing policy.
[26/12/15, 9:46:48 AM] Hemanth Yeddula: To sum it up, let's recall what Mahatma Gandhi said "First they Ignore you, then they ridicule you,then they fight you, and then you win". That's exactly what has happened in every act of AAP rights from its institution.

[26/12/15, 11:24:30 AM] ~ Srikanth Palle: Fine odd even is fine. Now where are we on the pollution thing? Odd even won't solve the issue. What else is being done and what are the results or expected results? What is the roadmap or the broader plan? Why is no one talking about this?
[26/12/15, 11:56:41 AM] Hemanth Yeddula: Yea it is found to be fine now for the simple reason after claiming that the policy was "a result of unsound was of mind as though he was incapable of knowing the nature of the act" that's how everyone sounded. Why wasn't this above question was posed when the policy was announced. That presumption of insanity is what Iam contesting
[26/12/15, 11:56:55 AM] Hemanth Yeddula: Coming to the action plan here it is

[26/12/15, 12:02:08 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: I hope everyone understands that No one ever talked about Delhi air pollution except paying a lip service. We need to appreciate the fact that a Government had the spine to take tough decisions when it is required for the common good knowing very well that it might be an unpopular one. It was a political risk taken for the benefit of all. We should applaud the courage
[26/12/15, 12:09:35 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: The choice was between waiting for another year for formulate an "All perfect-All mighty" policy or to have a policy with reasonable accuracy and first implement it(due to the urgency) and then improve it as we go ahead. It will be impractical to expect a " solution to a a complex problem like air pollution. Problems such as this should be imagined to be like "nth order Differential Equations", you start with certain boundary conditions and try to arrive at a solution based on estimates
[26/12/15, 12:11:54 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Then you improve upon the solution adding parameters to arrive as close to reality as possible. This policy is ultimately an empirical model, which needs several iterations

[26/12/15, 12:13:03 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: 😂😂😂😂
[26/12/15, 12:35:58 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Extract from the Holy Bible,Mathew 6:1-4- “Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. “Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you..
[26/12/15, 12:37:22 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: I hope political parties like BJP and Congress reads the above. For they exactly do the same thing and we feel those who do that are the ones who actually work, while the rest don't even exist
[26/12/15, 12:48:46 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: Bible also said that earth is flat
[26/12/15, 12:48:59 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: I mean no offense
[26/12/15, 12:58:19 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Please.. I would generally not like to comment on matters of faith,now that it has been mentioned let me put it in right perspective
[26/12/15, 12:59:23 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: One needs to differentiate between "The Church" and "Holy Bible". They are not the same, I hope everyone understands this much
[26/12/15, 12:59:32 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: So you should not have brought in bible to strengthen your discussion. It is never correct.
[26/12/15, 1:00:05 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Yes fine thanking you yours lovingly
[26/12/15, 1:00:51 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Please do not give it such a colour. Everyone who reads it will know what I meant. I respectfully quoted a beautiful verse from bible
[26/12/15, 1:01:14 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: There was absolutely no reason to bring in flatness of earth here
[26/12/15, 1:01:42 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: About church yest xmas so churches wer filled with all ppl full rush gud decoration

[26/12/15, 1:03:53 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: He grows potatoes in mars
[26/12/15, 1:04:12 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: I like that scene
[26/12/15, 1:04:29 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Hero stayed in mars for sol 596 days
[26/12/15, 1:04:44 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: It was very difficult I couldn't make it
[26/12/15, 1:05:01 PM] ~ 🤔: I think that this platform is just for exchange of ideas... Not to prove one self right or to influence others on his views ... Let's stick to that
[26/12/15, 1:05:06 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: It takes about 04 pillers being present on 4 corners. It does not talk about the geometry of earth nor the stability. It meagrely talks about the four cardinal directions
[26/12/15, 1:05:21 PM] ~ 🤔: Nobody is trying to compete...
[26/12/15, 1:05:21 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: But due to some problem his house get blasted

[26/12/15, 1:07:48 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: So it's was an Archaic belief in the ancient Roman Catholic Church regarding the Geometry of earth. At that point of time, printing of the Holy Bible was undertaken under the aegis of Roman Catholic Church
[26/12/15, 1:07:56 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: That is gud platform to advertise there movie
[26/12/15, 1:08:02 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Full comedy show

[26/12/15, 1:08:43 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: Aditya is not talking abt giving colours ... He is sayin that everyone will have his/her own opinion and we should respect it.
[26/12/15, 1:08:54 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: We use to buy geometry box in saibaba buk store

[26/12/15, 1:09:40 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: Simple
[26/12/15, 1:10:08 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Fair enough. What were you trying to say when you refers to earths geometry in Bible? Are you implying something?
[26/12/15, 1:10:43 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: He is saying geometry box is now cheaper buy it ani

[26/12/15, 2:09:41 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: I don't know about this particular temple, but when I went to Ajanta and Ellora there were Monolithic Temples...these have been carved out of a single piece of rock...carved top down. The entire epic of Ramayana and Mahabharata was carved on them. Such rich heritage
[26/12/15, 2:10:35 PM] Abhijeet Singh Rathod: Yeah this is placed on top of a hill rock
[26/12/15, 2:11:24 PM] Abhijeet Singh Rathod: With huge rocks used like pillars and carvings made out of it
[26/12/15, 2:11:55 PM] Abhijeet Singh Rathod: It speaks about shiv parvathi
[26/12/15, 2:12:42 PM] Abhijeet Singh Rathod: One more places to be visited are the belum caves at kurnool
[26/12/15, 2:14:14 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Exactly. These deities of Vishnu, Parvathi and shiva is a common feature. I was shocked to see even the Buddhist and Jain temples having many similarities with Hindu mythological figures, one can see them prominently in temples
[26/12/15, 2:14:21 PM] Abhijeet Singh Rathod: Nice place to visit on a weekend if you want to go for a long drive
[26/12/15, 2:14:58 PM] Abhijeet Singh Rathod: Yeah

[28/12/15, 12:03:01 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Again finally Wat I say is gudnght and jai telangana
[28/12/15, 12:14:15 AM] ~ Srikanth Palle: I'm not modi supporter but Kejriwal and all his supporters are so concentrated on modi for no reason. If Kejriwal wants to do good why should modi or someone else be brought into discussion. Coming to ram madhav he is just a sidekick. Unlike aap sidekicks are making stupid comments here. And what's wrong in what he said, if you think he wants to unite India, not convert people.

[28/12/15, 1:39:49 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: @ Sri...Going by that logic, Ideally the entire world should be united with no boundaries. One needs understand what is "Sovereignty of a Nation" before speaking english, just because you know English to a channel. Pakistan, Bangladesh etc are all Sovereign Nations with their own elected governments and constitutions. Concept of Akhand-Bharat will reduce them in to "Provinces" from the present status of "Nation states". No self respecting country which is worth its salt would feel ballooned with such an "Ideal" in the third world. One may say that, it was an innocent comment based in unity as an ideal. If that be so, his timing and context was nothing short of lunacy.
[28/12/15, 1:45:05 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: Fine then just rubbish them as talk by some sidekick.
[28/12/15, 1:46:38 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: That what I did. I responded when some logic was being extracted out of it
[29/12/15, 12:13:37 AM] ~ Srikanth Palle: I saw the interview. You are talking about a show where mehdi hasan is the host and Al Jazeera is the channels. 
Lol
[29/12/15, 12:14:15 AM] ~ Srikanth Palle: Let's take this conversation private and not spoil anyones sleep
[29/12/15, 2:24:36 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Yes right. All he managed to do was to a create suspicion
[29/12/15, 4:11:17 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Don't miss Delhi CMs interview to Barkha Dutt in NDTV 24x7 today at 9PM. Shocking facts about Delhi Cricket Association and words of wisdom to BJP. I wonder who will bell the cat in Hyderabad Cricket Association. They are the "Kalmadis of Cricket" who ruined careers of thousands of budding cricketers of Hyderabad. No wonder Hyderabad Ranji team was all out for a meagre 22Runs in 2014 Ranji, if I can recollect correctly. What a shame
[29/12/15, 7:24:11 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: Barkha dutt and Kejriwal combination - synonym of credibility
[29/12/15, 7:24:27 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: And sensationalism

[30/12/15, 10:48:48 AM] ~ Srikanth Palle: TEACHER: bachchon.... Kya tum ek ched ke under do ched daal sakte ho.???? 

BACHCHE: nahi sir... 

TEACHER: Theek hai. Tum ghar jaakar apne parents ki madad lekar mujhe kal iska jawaab dena 

Agle din bachche school aaye magar kisi ke paas jawaab nahi tha. Teacher ko bohot hansi aayi 

TEACHER: tumhare parents bhi kitne budhdhu hai. Iska jawaab bohot aasan hai... 

Ye kehkar teacher ne apne haath ki pehli ungli ko angoothe se milaya aur ek ring banaya. Phir us ring ko apne naak ke do ched par lagaya aur kaha "dekho kitna aasana jawab tha. Maine apni unglion se ek ched banaya aur apne naak ke do ched ke upar rakha aur isi tarha ek ched ke under do ched daal diye. Tumhare parents itna aasan jawab bhi nahi de paye. 

Agle din student teacher ke paas aaya 

STUDENT: Sir mere papa ne poocha hai ke kya aap ek ched ke under saat ched daal sakte hain??? 

TEACHER: nahi... Wo to impossible hai. 

STUDENT: Possible hai. Mere papa ne kaha hai ke apne sir se kaho. Ek bansuri le apni gand mei daal le

[30/12/15, 5:54:59 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: One of the very well advocated articles I've read so far by Justice Markandey Katju (former Judge Supreme Court of India)
[30/12/15, 5:55:12 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Excellent arguments
[30/12/15, 10:23:55 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: One Doubt- If we consider an individual a part of the society, as per law, to whom does his body belong to(biologically ofcourse it is his)? Is it actually the property of "State"? Because on one side it's only the state who can  take life viz. a death sentence & on the other hand suicide,self harm & harming others is illegal.
[30/12/15, 10:24:24 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Just a thought
[30/12/15, 10:29:38 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Apologies for using disturbing words above. Just for academic purpose
[30/12/15, 11:00:30 PM] ~ 🤔: Suicide is no longer illegal... Secondly ... Get married soon bhai...u seriously need a life😜

[30/12/15, 11:13:42 PM] ~ 🤔: Police can't interfere ... Supreme court directives...
[30/12/15, 11:14:11 PM] ~ 🤔: We have amendment to army rule as well to that effect
[30/12/15, 11:14:55 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: I have a logical question ... How can you punish someone who committed suicide
[30/12/15, 11:15:13 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Okay ok. No actually I dint know that..
[30/12/15, 11:15:16 PM] ~ 🤔: Was also a staff college question recently if I m not wrong
[30/12/15, 11:15:37 PM] ~ 🤔: Attempted suicide dude
[30/12/15, 11:16:25 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: @ Srikanth...The person who completes suicide cannot be punished. And yes as Adi said it is "attempt" to commit suicide Which is a crime
[30/12/15, 11:16:32 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Now he says it isn't
[30/12/15, 11:16:41 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: I dint know that
[30/12/15, 11:17:06 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: So divide is fine but attention and failing is not .. As per law

[30/12/15, 11:19:14 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: If two people attempt suicide and one dies and other fails to die ... We punish him because he did not die
[30/12/15, 11:19:27 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Haha yea kind of
[30/12/15, 11:19:35 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: That's the law

[30/12/15, 11:22:31 PM] ~ 🤔: Yes ... However the army rule has been amended to find it fit for trial in good order and mil discp .. For an act unbecoming of an officer/ soldier punishable by court martial
[30/12/15, 11:22:40 PM] ~ 🤔: And summary discharge...
[30/12/15, 11:23:00 PM] ~ 🤔: Aa63

[31/12/15, 10:54:54 AM] ~ Srikanth Palle: Lol Sravan
[31/12/15, 1:06:49 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: @ Adi..No plans of leave as yet. Will let u know
[31/12/15, 1:27:07 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: @ Sri..I think you quietly admire Kejriwal
[31/12/15, 4:00:28 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: IAS Panthi-Time has come to replace beuracrats with  professionals and sector experts,infuse fresh ideas in governance-Delhi CM. Now IAS guys are sitting on Dharna. I haven't seen any officer in private,military and and for that matter even in public sector to stoop so low. These guys are Generalist officers, ofcourse smart. All of us are, who isn't. But they feel clearing IAS exam is the pinnacle of life, after that there is only heaven to reach. As if all you guys in corporate sector(who are actually the engines of Indian Economy) are fools. All of you will be a shocked to know that, for these babus their merit is decided based on the rank they get in IAS and that will continue to be the benchmark on which their future promotions are based in(ACR actual lay doesn't have much of value). Next you will be even more shocked to know that there is something called NFU-Non functional upgradation, I.e, the entire batch of particular course of IAS officer gets pay equal to the highest paying batchmate of their course. And lastly, all of them the entire batch retire as secretaries atleast.So to draw a parallel,it's like based on the score you guys get in your entrance interviews and exams your future promotions are based(irrespective of whether u perform or not). Next, all of you irrespective of your performance and talent can retire as Vice Presidents and CEOs and you pay is always on par with your highest paying colleague
[31/12/15, 4:02:59 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: In military, the pyramidal structure is so so steep that, only a handful make it to the rank of full colonel/Captain/Grp Captain that too after having excellent ACRs. Forget about Generals and Admirals. We have to get screwed in training first and then write exams to get promoted.
[31/12/15, 4:05:06 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Even a Param Vir Chakra cannot guarantee your promotion. And then what you get..Hard lying allowance for a army guy posted on Siachen gets 31k followed by a submariner who gets around 26k as allowance while a babu in Guwahati gets 70k as hard lying allowance.
[31/12/15, 4:09:48 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: The best comedy of all..."Who is the in charge of National Security of India"??? Surprise Surprise Surprise..it's not Generals or Admirals or Air Chief Marshals...it is " Defence Secretary". An IAS who may be from petroleum ministry who does not know what is the difference between Guerrilla  and Gorilla, a mortar from motor and a gun from howitzer in Field Marshall Sam Manekshaws words.
[31/12/15, 4:11:28 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Even the corporate wizards and CEOs are made to stand outside the their rooms is South Block and North Block. Where in these guys don't even have a figment of their intelligence but create a negative demand by showing off their bureaucracy and generate scrap value
[31/12/15, 4:12:42 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: It's time al you guys who have vertical expertise in your fields are invited to work for govt on temporary deputations. India will grow, it would be a small step but a giant leap.
[31/12/15, 4:19:02 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Let me tell you with conviction. You need not get awed by the pomp these Babus have around themselves. The competition you guys face outside and in the face of it you guys succeed with all the insecurities is no match to there IAS guys. I tell this will conviction and after seeing them work very closely. No doubt there are good people amongst them, where aren't they. But, the competence which you people develop after slogging in your careers is unmatchable. These idiots can only throw their official weight around. The only way to counter these minnows is speaking your core subject out confidently. They will piss in their pants
[31/12/15, 4:19:39 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Ayithey apudu emaindi antey
[31/12/15, 4:19:52 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Nenu chepana

[31/12/15, 4:23:22 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Jai telangana
[31/12/15, 4:24:23 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Advise for Business guys-Those of you who deal with govt contracts. Beware of these idiots. You don't need to do any lobbying and pleasing. If you are doing an honest business with good technical skills there is nothing stopping you from getting your contracts. There is nothing to fear. If you try to plead them, then they will make you buy ghee ka dabbas, ull have to take their children to schools, arrange cars for madam for vegetable shopping and sponsor air tickets for Singapore trip. But if you want to really be something big in life, believe me, trust yourself and be honest. You will get your contract when you rightly deserve it. Law will save you no these babis
[31/12/15, 4:24:37 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: @sravan-Over and out
[31/12/15, 4:26:44 PM] Abhijeet Singh Rathod: 😂
[31/12/15, 4:27:04 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: 🙌
[31/12/15, 5:00:06 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: And last advice- Never ever,ever Never send New Year calendars and diaries to these Bureaucrats. Mainly those on Central deputation. After that the only thing you will end up doing is to open a printing press to keep making calendars and dairies not only for them but for their entire clan all through the year.One shipyard (don't want to name them) dint heed my advice in 2013,the price which they are paying even today so dearly.
[31/12/15, 5:00:45 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Ayithey yemaindi antey

[01/01/16, 4:27:08 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Starting mohan babu was preparing for ias
[01/01/16, 4:27:36 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Suddenly he passes his exam and appointed as deputy collector

[01/01/16, 4:47:19 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: 😳
[01/01/16, 4:50:57 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: I think Ministry of Rural Development should make the Directors/ Faculty of the NIRD or Scientists from Rural development background as Director Generals. Else, this is what will happen. While the actual on ground work is done by the concerned Faculty, these IAS guys sitting on top not only take all the credit, but have a honey moon time
[01/01/16, 4:53:41 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: What else NIRD or Manage or NAARM can be for a generalist IAS fellow who does not have any clue of agricultural research to head the organisation except going around aimlessly and finally scribbling on a file(which is entirely prepared by the faculty) a small signature in the end(it's popularly called Guggi maarna).

Kejriwal- One day only females will come out of houses and other day only males 😝😂😂😂
[07/01/16, 10:04:33 AM] Hemanth Yeddula: Sounds like it's a reply of Delhi Police Commissioner BS Bassi. Delhi CM has "NIL" control on Delhi Police as Delhi police(who is responsible for women security),unlike other state police doesn't report to CM, it reports to Central Government(Home Minister) through Lieutenant Governor.

[15/01/16, 12:57:20 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: Kudos to the brave Lawyer who is fighting not for young women to be allowed in to Sabarimala temple.In an affidavit submitted by Travancore Devasvom board and Govt of Kerala to Supreme Court, they say young women who are of reproductive age who are menstruating are considered "impure". By that logic, all of us who are men who are born out of the same "impurity" should also be "Impure". Same applies to Mosques who prohibit women from entering the sanctum sanctorum of the mosque. In a country where women are worshiped as goddesses such archaic practices have no place. Iam sure Lord Ayyappa would agree with me, Iam sure he never meant it to be that way. All the "Swamis" who go to Sabarimala on a pilgrimage every year practice celibacy with self restraint with devotion. How does a touch from a women in family makes the vow to break? How can a mother, sister or a wife make one impure? No god in his right mind would tell one to do that, it is wet he meagre humans who interpret him wrongly and blame it on him.
[15/01/16, 1:15:35 PM] Hemanth Yeddula: They say it a matter of faith and faith cannot be questioned under Indian Law. They are correct. But here is the counter:- According to the legend, "Lord Ayyappa after killing a women demon and was going to Sabarimala to cure his believes.A beautiful women who was under the curse in the form of the demon,who was killed by the Lord was cured of her curse and offered herself to Lord to marry her. The Lord who is a celibate tells to the lady, I will marry the day all "Kanni swamis(first time Sabarimala goers) stop coming to me, I.e in a way to avoid marrying her ever. It is believed  that the lady is waiting for the Lord to marry her till date". There ends the story. Now where in this story lord Ayyappa told that young women who are of reproductive age are impure and they can't come to him? So it's conclusively proven that it is not a matter of faith but only a custom. Customs are not protected under Indian Law, example Sati. So this argument is misplaced hence null and void.

[18/01/16, 10:37:03 PM] Vikram: Some years ago, there was a Mensa convention in San Francisco.

Mensa, is an international organization for people who have an IQ of 140 or higher.

Several of the Mensa members went out for lunch at a local cafe. When they sat down, one of them discovered that their salt shaker contained pepper, and their pepper shaker was full of salt.

How could they swap the contents of the two bottles without spilling any, and using only the implements at hand? Clearly -- this was a job for Mensa minds.

The group debated the problem and presented ideas and finally, came up with a brilliant solution involving a napkin, a straw, and an empty saucer.

They then called the waitress over, ready to dazzle her with their solution.

"Ma'am," they said, "we couldn't help but notice that the pepper shaker contains salt and the salt shaker contains pepper..."

But before they could finish, the waitress interrupted & said...

"Oh -- sorry about that."

She leaned over the table, unscrewed the caps of both bottles and switched them.

There was dead silence at the Mensa table.

For most of the problems there are simple solutions but it is our “Brilliant” minds that complicate every simple solution. Take a re-look at life, you will find non issues mostly!
[19/01/16, 11:59:02 AM] Abhijeet Singh Rathod: All salaried people must read this:

After 4 years of selfless service, I realized that I had not been promoted, no salary increment, no commendation.
So I decided to walk up to my HR Manager. The manager looked at me, smiled and asked me to sit down saying: "My friend you have not worked here for even a single day!"

I was shocked to hear this, but the manager went on to explain. And here's the conversation that took place:

Manager: How many days are there in a year?

Me: 365 days and sometimes 366.

Manager: Do you come to work on weekends?

Me: No sir.

Manager: How many days are there in a year that are weekends?

Me: 52 Saturdays and 52 Sundays equals to 104 days.

Manager: Thanks for that. If u remove 104 days from 366 days. how many days
do you now have?

Me: 262 days

Manager: How many hours make up a day?

Me: 24 Hours.

Manager: How long do you work in a day?

Me: 10am to 6pm 
(i.e. 8 hours a day.)

Manager: So, what fraction of the day do you work in hours?

Me: 8/24 
i.e 1/3 (one third).

Manager: This is nice of you! what is 1/3rd of 262 days?

Me: 87
(1/3 x 262 = 87days)

Manager: I do give you 2 weeks sick leave, 15 days casual leave, 5 days optional leave, 30 days earned leave every year. Now remove that 64 days from the 87 days left. How many days do u have remaining?

Me: 23 days.

Manager: Do you work on festivals ? (20 days)

Me: No Sir!

Manager: Do you work on Republic Day?

Me: No sir!

Manager: Do you come to work on Independence Day?

Me: No sir!

Manager: So how many days are left?

Me: 1 day sir!

Manager: Do you come to work on New Year's Day..?

Me: No sir..!!

Manager: So how many days are left?

Me: None Sir!

Manager: So what are you claiming?

Me: I have understood, Sir. I did not realise that I was stealing company
money all these days.

Moral - NEVER GO TO HR FOR HELP!!!

(HR= HIGH RISK.) 😀😀😀👆👆
[19/01/16, 2:41:22 PM] Avinash Rajendran: Back on January 4th, a group of Ocala Florida bikers were riding east on Hwy.40  when they saw a girl about to jump off the Blackwater Bridge. So they stopped.

George, their leader, a big burly man of 53, gets off his Harley, walks through a group of gawkers, past the State Trooper who was trying to talk her down off the railing, and says,
"Hey Baby . . . whatcha doin' up there on that railin'?"

She says tearfully, "I'm going to commit suicide!!"

While he didn't want to appear "sensitive," George also didn't want to miss this "be-a-legend" opportunity either so he asked . . . "Well, before you jump, Honey-Babe . . .
why don't you give ol' George here your best last kiss?"

So, with no hesitation at all, she leaned back over the railing and did just that . . .
and it was a long, deep, lingering tongue swapping kiss followed immediately by another even better one.

After they breathlessly finished, George gets a big thumbs-up approval from his biker-buddies, the onlookers, and even the State Trooper, and then says, "Wow! That was the best kiss I have ever had! That's a real talent you're wasting there, Sugar Shorts. You could be famous if you rode with me. Why are you committing suicide?"

"My parents don't like me dressing up like a girl."

It's still unclear whether she jumped or was pushed.

So we want to strengthen this feeling through the sacrament of marriage. Witness our eternal love, see you at our wedding

[06/05/16, 2:37:40 PM] ~ Srikanth Palle: 2 tamil men get onto a bus in New York. They sit down & engage in an animated conversation. 

The lady sitting next 2 them ignores them at first, but her attention is galvanized when she hears 1 of them say the following:

"Emma cums first.
 Den I cum.
 Den two asses cum together.
 I cum once-a-more!
 2 asses, they cum 2gether again.
 I cum again and pee twice.
Then I cum one lasta time."

The lady can't take this any more and shouts "You foul- mouthed Indian, in this country we don't speak aloud in public places about our personal lives however extraordinary they are."

"Hey, coola down lady,' said the man. "I am a justa tellin' my frienda how to spell Mississippi."

(I swear you're gonna read this again) .

    A Must Must Read 
     A Scene in 2020...

⚡Operator: 
Hello Pizza Hut!

Customer: Hello, can you please take my order?

⚡Operator : Can I have your multi purpose Aadhar card number first, Sir?

Customer: Yeah! 
Hold on.....  My number is 889861356102049998-45-54610

⚡Operator : OK... you're... Mr SYED and you're calling from 155, 1st Cross. Panduranga Nagar, MG Road,  Hyderabad. . Your home number is 26490786, your office 22211379  and your mobile is 9880088786. You are calling from you home number now.

Customer: (Astonished) How did you get all my phone numbers?

⚡Operator : We are connected to the system, Sir.

Customer: I wish to order your Seafood Pizza...

⚡Operator : That's not a good idea Sir.

Customer: How come?

⚡Operator : According to your medical records, you have high blood pressure and even higher cholesterol level, sir.

Customer: What?... What do you recommend then?

⚡Operator : Try our Low Fat Hokkien Mee Pizza. You'll like it.

Customer: How do you know for sure?

⚡Operator : You borrowed a book titled 'Popular Hokkien Dishes' from the National Library last week, sir.

Customer: OK I give up... Give me three family size ones then.

⚡Operator : That should be enough for your family of 07. Sir. The total is Rs. 2,450.

Customer: Can I pay by credit card?

⚡Operator : I'm afraid you have to pay us cash, Sir. Your credit card is over the limit and you owe your bank Rs. 1,51,758 since October last year. That's not including the late payment charges on your housing loan, Sir.

Customer: I guess I have to run to the neighbourhood ATM and withdraw some cash before your guy arrives.

⚡Operator : You can't Sir. Based on the records, you've exhausted even your overdraft limit.

Customer: Never mind just send the pizzas, I'll have the cash ready. How long is it gonna take anyway?

⚡Operator : About 45 minutes Sir, but if you can't wait you can always come and collect it on your motorcycle.

Customer: What?

⚡Operator : According to the details in the system , you own a motorcycle registration number 7786

Customer: "????" (hmmm.. these guys know my motorcyle number too!)

⚡Operator : Is there anything else, sir?

Customer: Nothing.! .. by the way... aren't you giving me that 3 free bottles of cola as advertised?

⚡Operator : We normally would sir, but based on your records, you're also diabetic... In the best interest of your health, we are holding this offer for you.

Customer: teri😡 

⚡Operator: Better mind your language sir. Remember on 10th July 1986 you were imprisoned for 3 days and fined Rs.5,000 for using abusive language against a policeman...?

Customer faints...😀😳😛😳😀😷😱  😖😜😰...

Confession of IT Engineer..

One day I was facing some issue with Outlook and I raised a ticket to get it resolved. I got a call from Service desk lady after some time and it went this way:

Lady: Hi I'm calling from service desk, what is the problem?

Me: (I explained the problem).

Lady: Can you please share your screen and give me the control so that I can solve the issue?

Me: (I shared the screen and gave the control. She solved it!!)

Lady: You may close the ticket from your end, the issue is solved.

Me: Thank you very much, I will close the ticket.

I opened her profile in lync and had a look at her profile. The display pic looked small in size. I instantly messaged her Employee ID to my colleague and asked him to have a look at her. He replied "She looks good in some angles".

I tried searching her FB profile with the help of her name, but there were too many results.

I started searching on linked in instead, I found her profile this time. I was trying to enlarge the profile pic and suddenly a message popped up - it says

" You may please stop sharing your screen!!..😂😂😂

[23/05/16, 3:24:07 PM] Vikram: Once upon a time ..a small boy named Basheer lived in a tiny Moroccan village. All his classmates hated him for his stupidity especially his teacher who was always yelling at him "you are driving me crazy Basheer"...

One day his mother went to check out how he is doing at school and the teacher told her honestly that her son is simply a disaster, getting very low marks and never had she seen such a dumb boy in her whole career...

The mother could not accept such a feed back and she took her son out from that school. she even shifted to another city ...

25 years later, that teacher got a cardio disorder and all the doctors have advised her to go for an open heart operation which only one surgeon could perform..

Left with no other choice she did it and the surgery was successful ...when she opened her eyes, she saw a handsome doctor smiling to her, being under anesthesia effect, she wanted to thank him but could not talk, in turn, he was staring at her face which started turning blue, she was raising her hand trying to tell him some thing but in vain and eventually died...

The doctor was shocked and was trying to understand what just happened, till he turned back and saw our friend Basheer working as a cleaner in that hospital who unplugged the ventilator to connect his vacuum cleaner......      
                 
If you were thinking that Basheer became a doctor, its because you have been watching too many Indian movies, serials or have read too many motivational foward messages...

Basheer is Basheer. 😂😂
[24/05/16, 3:34:31 AM] Sandeep Vallapu: I feel its certainly not a message one should be sharing it in their school group...Demotivating 😜 have Cannibis for firing d neutrons!!👌

[16/07/16, 11:23:45 AM] Vikram: This is hilarious
It was the first day of a school in USA and a new Indian student named Chandrasekhar Subramanian entered the fourth grade.

The teacher said, "Let's begin by reviewing some American History. Who said 'Give me Liberty, or give me Death'?"

She saw a sea of blank faces except for Chandrasekhar, who had his hand up: 'Patrick Henry, 1775,' he said.

'Very good! Who said 'Government of the People, by the People, for the People, shall not perish from the Earth?''

Again, no response except from Chandrasekhar. 'Abraham Lincoln, 1863' said Chandrasekhar.

The teacher snapped at the class, 'Class, you should be ashamed. Chandrasekhar, who is new to our country, knows more about our history than you do.'

She heard a loud whisper: 'F ___ the Indians'

'Who said that?' she demanded. Chandrasekhar put his hand up. 'General Custer, 1862.'

At that point, a student in the back said, 'I'm gonna puke.'

The teacher glares around and asks 'All right! Now, who said that?' Again, Chandrasekhar says, 'George H. W. Bush to the Japanese Prime Minister, 1991.'

Now furious, another student yells, 'Oh yeah? Suck this!'

Chandrasekhar jumps out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to the teacher, 'Bill Clinton, to Monica Lewinsky, 1997.'

Now with almost mob hysteria someone said 'You little shit. If you say anything else, I'll kill you.' Chandrasekhar frantically yells at the top of his voice, 'Michael Jackson (musician) to the child witnesses testifying against him, 2004.'

The teacher fainted. And as the class gathered around the teacher on the floor, someone said, 'Oh shit, we're screwed!' And Chandrasekhar said quietly, 'I think it was Lehman Brothers, September 15th, 2008'.

[30/07/16, 12:02:23 AM] Rahul Adiyala: Classic 

One day The guru told the disciple :
Go to the rose garden and come back with the tallest rose plant. One condition is that you should not come back the same path you took while going.

The disciple went to the garden and came back empty handed. When asked why, the disciple gave his answer: 

As I went in, I saw a tall beautiful tree. But, I kept going on for the next tree expecting a better tree. But moving forward, I came across only smaller plants and since, I cannot trace the path back, I had to return empty handed.

The guru said: this is *Love*😄

Then he said: now go to the sunflower garden and bring the most beautiful sunflower plant.

Now the additional condition is that once you pluck a sunflower plant, you can't pluck another.

Now the disciple goes into the garden and comes back quickly with a plant. The guru asks, is this the most beautiful plant? 

The disciple says: No guru. Based on my previous experience, I did not want to miss and hence, I took the first plant which looked beautiful to me. On the way back, I saw more beautiful plants but since I was not allowed to pick another plant, I came back with the plant, I had originally picked.

The guru smiled and said: this is *Marriage*...

[10/10/16, 4:05:06 PM] Vikram: You Can't question on 'surgical strikes' but Govt can cut army's disability pension? 
Must Read.
While 'surgical strikes' were under way, govt cut Army's disability pensions.
As army para-commandos slipped silently across the Line of Control (LoC) on September 28 on a perilous mission to punish anti-India jihadis and their Pakistani army backers, the Government of India quietly put the finishing touches on a plan to slash disability pensions for injuries incurred in the line of duty.

On September 30, the day after India began celebrating the successful “surgical strikes”, the ministry of defence (MoD) issued a letter that dramatically reduced pensions for soldiers invalided out from the army after being crippled by battle injuries, or by injuries directly attributable to hazardous military service.

If a young soldier with severe injuries — what cold medical jargon terms “100 per cent disability” — from that operation had been invalided out from service, he would have found his monthly pension slashed from Rs 45,200 to just Rs 27,200 — down by Rs 18,000 a month.

The team leaders in the “surgical strikes”, majors with 10 years of service, have been hit even harder — with pension for 100 per cent disability slashed by over Rs 70,000 a month. 

Junior commissioned officers, the spine of the army, are also badly affected. Naib subedars with 26 years of service will find their 100 per cent disability pensions slashed by Rs 40,000 a month.

per cent disability in battle were entitled disability pension that matched their last pay drawn. In addition, they would draw a “service component” of pension, which amounted to 50 per cent of their last pay drawn.

Under the new rules, which come into effect retrospectively from January 1, 2016, the “service component” remains unchanged, but a “slab system” has been introduced for disability pension, which is significantly lower than the percentage system — Rs 27,000 a month for officers, 17,000 for junior commissioned officers (JCOs), and Rs 12,000 for all other ranks (ORs).

A soldier with five years of service earns Rs 30,400 a month; 100 per cent disability pension would match that figure. In its place, he will now be entitled to a flat rate of Rs 12,000 a month. A major with 10 years of service earns Rs 98,300 a month. In place of that figure for 100 per cent disability, he will get just Rs 27,000 a month.

According to the army headquarter’s calculations, the new “slab system” would cause a loss of Rs 2,040 a month to a senior sepoy with 100 per cent disability, Rs 3,472 to a subedar, and Rs 6,855 per month to a lieutenant colonel.

[11/10/16, 12:16:00 AM] Vikram: Fakendra claimed to get a surgical strike done within 2 kms of LOC and employed his trolls to show us that now he  has a 72" chati. 

In 2011, Indian commandos  spent more than 48 hours deep inside Pakistan, killed Pakistani Regular Army soldiers  (Not half trained terrorists) and brought back the heads of 3 to avenge the head trophy hunting by Pakistanis. 

The the  then government took abuse even from the likes of Fakendra but didn't brag about this. 

Results : Cross border attacks came down, Kashmir was relatively calm. 
Post Fakendra's  bragging, 2 attacks have already taken place on army camps. Fools have been given power

1. Simply download "1 MG - Health App for India" now it is 6mb software on your Android device 

2. Search the medicine name

3. Type the medicine name which you are using (e. g. Lyrica 75mg (Pfizer company)

4. It will show u medicine company, prices and Ingredients

5. Now main point CLICK ON 'SUBSTITUTE'

6. Don't be surprised to see that same drug is available at very low cost also. And that to by other reputed manufacturer. e. g. Lyrica by pfizer is for Rs. 768.56 for 14 tab (54.89 per tab). Whereas same drug by Cipla (Prebaxe) is available ONLY @ Rs. 59.00 for 10 tab (5.9 per tab) 

Please don't delete this without forwarding.

Forward to all the contacts in your phone book.

Let the move by Supreme Court benefit everyone...

There was a big lobby by Pharma companies to stop generic medicines. But court kept the interest of common man and the medical need.

I would like to take this opportunity to categorically state that the reports appearing in large parts of the media- both print and electronic - to the effect that my name has been shortlisted by the selection board to succeed Cyrus Misty as the chairman of Tata Sons are unfounded, motivated and spread by my business rivals in order to cause panic, both locally and globally. 

It's a fact, though, that Ratan Tata did call me a couple of times in recent times; but we never discussed the issue of succession. All that we talked about was whether my Tata Sky connection was working properly now. 😜😜😜

Chintu: Sir, Can I ask you one question?

Professor: Yes.

Chintu: If you can answer this question, I will accept my final marks, if you cant, you will have to give me an "A" grading.
 
Professor agreed.
 .
 .
 .

Chintu asked: "What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal & neither legal nor logical?"

Prof thought about it for hrs & pondered but couldnt think of an  answer.

He had to finally give up as he really didnot know the answer.

He gave this boy an "A" grading as promised.

The following day, Professor asked same question to his students.

He was shocked when all of them raised their hands.

He asked one student.

He answered:

Sir, you are 65, married to a  28 yrs old woman, this is legal but not logical.

Your wife, is having an affair with a 23 year old boy, this is logical but not legal.

Your wife's boyfriend has failed in his exam & yet you have given him an "A", this is neither logical nor legal. 😎

One day a florist went to a barber for a haircut. 
After the cut, he asked about his bill, and the barber replied, 'I cannot accept money from you, I'm doing community service this week.

The florist was pleased and left the shop. 

When the barber went to open his shop the next morning, there was a 'Thank You' card and a dozen roses waiting for him at his door. 

Later, a grocer comes in for a haircut, and when he tried to pay his bill, the barber again replied, 'I cannot accept money from you , I'm doing community service this week.

The grocer was happy and left the shop. 

The next morning when the barber went to open up, there was a 'Thank You' card and a bag of fresh vegetables waiting for him at his door.

Then a politician came in for a haircut, and when he went to pay his bill, the barber again replied, 'I cannot accept money from you. I'm doing community service this week.

The politician was very happy and left the shop. 

The next morning, when the barber went to open up, 
there were a dozen politicians lined up waiting for a free haircut. 

And that, my friends, illustrates the fundamental difference between the citizens of our country and the politicians who run it. 

If you don't forward this, someone will miss a good laugh.

[06/12/16, 9:05:03 AM] Abhijeet Singh Rathod: Towards the end of the year 1997, many countries in South East Asia suffered from a massive financial crisis. Amongst those, South Korea was perhaps the most affected, where the Korean currency “Won" depreciated so much so rapidly, that it left a huge USD 50 Billion hole in the country’s economy. This rapid downfall collapsed and crushed the very backbone of South Korean economy, prompting the International Monetary Fund to extend billions of dollars of a tough bailout package.
Many banks and industrial houses had to close down and thousands of citizens lost jobs. And yet the way these very citizens responded to the national calling is probably a unique example in history. 
In January 1998, South Korea started a campaign called “Collect Gold for Love of Korea” with the help of Samsung, Hyundai and Daewoo corporation. The government simply appealed to citizens to donate their gold voluntarily. And to the surprise of the entire world people gave away almost everything that was dear to them or had worked hard their entire life for. Housewives donated wedding rings, athletes donated medals, lucky keys, charms etc., and all this was done on the streets on Seoul where officials from these 3 companies would just roam the streets with huge bags, simply asking people to donate gold and people would simply reach out to their rings and put them in the bags, with eyes full of tears. No written accounts of who donated what, no promise or commitment that someday the country will repay it back to you. Nothing. And the outcome?

South Koreans collected almost USD 200 Million worth gold from its Citizens. Simply given away to the country. Obviously given the magnitude of the debt, this amount hardly made any dent but considering the population in 1997 was just over 45 Million, it was a “Herculean" effort.
During the same period the world was taken by storm by the movie, Titanic. But in entire South Korea, not one ticket was sold for the first two weeks. When international reporters interviewed people on the street, the answer was simple. “If we buy tickets in Won*, it would get converted to US Dollars and would leave South Korea. We cannot afford Dollars.”

The above two events have left a very deep and indelible impression on my mind. South Korea came out of the financial crisis quickly (by end of 1999) and today ranks amongst top 10 economies in the world. 

Today, we stand at a cusp of what can transform India into a great nation, and no one is asking for gold nor asking to give up all that we have legitimately accumulated through diligence and hard work. All that is expected from us is patience, faith, bit of hardship too; for about 3 months and additionally if we can manage, then some love for the country. That's all, and we will have an opportunity to carry that sense of pride on our chest and sleeves for generations to come and look in the eyes of our children and grandchildren and say to them, “We made it Count”.
Selflessness motivates me.

Immense national pride motivates me.
Optimism motivates me.
Finally one more request is  use only made in India products ...
Things will definitely change.  

🙏

[01/01/17, 1:17:02 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Today is a universal day where everyone talks about goals, dreams, plans and hopes. We talk about it, we dream about it. But often we don't (really) plan for it, sweat for it, sacrifice for it, work for it, get uncomfortable for it. 

We just kind of 'hope' it will happen. Hopefully success will fall on us from a great height.

Motivation is temporary. For most people, motivation is a feeling; an emotional state. If we only do when we feel motivated, we'll never create real (forever) change. 

Success is always less about motivation and more about planning, self-control, discipline, organization, time-management, decision making and mental toughness.

A better life ain't about the New Year....It's about the New YOU ! 

HAPPY NEW YEAR

[09/01/17, 10:30:06 AM] ~ Phan!: V.V.IMP message from central government. New step again.
This is definitely going to save u money..   

Dear All,

This is to inform you that medicines are prescribed (by doctors) by brand name & not by the generics (Ingredients). Hence we end up paying more money for the same medicine.

Follow these few steps to know more & start saving on your medical bills.

1. Simply goto www.Manddo.com (Medicines and Doctors online) goto medicines secton

2. Search the medicine name

3. Type the medicine name which you are using (e. g. Lyrica 75mg (Pfizer company)

4. It will show u medicine company, prices and Ingredients

5. Now main point CLICK ON 'SUBSTITUTE'

6. Don't be surprised to see that same drug is available at very low cost also. And that to by other reputed manufacturer. e. g. Lyrica by pfizer is for Rs. 768.56 for 14 tab (54.89 per tab). Whereas same drug by Cipla (Prebaxe) is available ONLY @ Rs. 59.00 for 10 tab (5.9 per tab) 

Please don't delete this without forwarding.

Forward to all the contacts in your phone book.

Let the move by Supreme Court benefit everyone...

There was a big lobby by Pharma companies to stop generic medicines. But court kept the interest of common man and the medical need.

[17/03/17, 2:33:05 PM] Avinash Rajendran: New trains have been announced today in the name of celebrities.....

Modi Express :- Will not stop anywhere till it reaches the destination.

Aamir Khan Express :- Will run once in a year and pick the passengers as per its choice.

Salman Khan Express :- Can even run on the footpath.

Manmohan Express :- The one and only silent train.

Dhoni Express :- 95% journey @ 10km/hr and remaining 5% @ 400km/hr.

Mamata Express :- Will run in the opposite direction of the destination.

Rahul Gandhi Express :- Will get derailed repeatedly.

Congress Express :- An experienced driver in each coach, but driver of engine on leave.

Amit Shah Express :- Covers the whole country except Delhi.

Kejriwal Express :- Sure to start, but has no idea where to go, so no guarantee it will reach its destination...could even stop midway if the driver decides to abandon the train.

& finally, Indian Railways Super Star......

Rajnikant Express :- The train will remain stationary, and all the stations will come and go!!! 😁

Deer Sir,
 
Sub.: Live aplikason for eye coming 

I will  not come  as my  eyes have come. If I come with  my coming eyes then  your eyes  will come  & you will not come. But still if you  come with your  coming  eyes all school eyes  will come  & all  will not  come. So  I will  not come   and all  will  come.  I  will come  back  when  my  coming eyes  will  go & all will  come  without their eyes coming.

Yours  Sincerely

Narendra Modi, walked into a bar around 9:58 pm. He sat down next to a Rahul Gandhi at the bar and stared up at the TV.

The 10 pm news was coming on. The news crew was covering the story of a man on the ledge of a large building preparing to jump.

The Rahul looked at Modi and said, "Do you think he will jump?"...

Modi said, "You know, I bet he will jump."

The Rahul replied, "Well, I bet he won't."

Modi placed a Rs. 1000 bill on the bar and said, "You're on!"

Just as the Rahul placed his money on the bar, the guy on the ledge jumped off the building, falling to his death.

The Rahul was very upset, but willingly handed his Rs.1000 to Modi,  saying, "Fair is fair. Here's your money."

Modi replied, "I can't take your money. I saw this earlier on the 5 pm news, and so I knew he would jump."

The Rahul replied, "I did too, but didn't think he would do it again.

Modi took the money.
😂😂😁😁

[05/04/17, 2:49:05 PM] Vikram: A man had 3 girlfriends but didn't know which one to marry. As a test he gave $5000 to each one to see how they spend it.
First girlfriend went out and get herself a  complete makeover . She told him ' I spent the money so that I could look pretty for u because I love you so much '
Second Girlfriend bought new golf clubs for men . She said I bought this for u because I love u so much .
Third one took $5000 ..invested in stock market ...doubled the investment and returned $5000 to men and reinvested the rest . She said 'I am reinvesting the money for our future because I love you so much.
The men then thought long and hard about each girlfriends about how they spent the money and Finally decided to
Marry the one with big tits .
Men are simple.

Did you know that, if you bath at least twice daily, avoid alcohol, avoid smoking tobacco and go to gym everyday for fitness, have sufficient sleep, eat fruits after each meal, avoid stress, stop using all sorts of drugs including caffeine found in tea and coffee and practise yoga regularly, you will still die when your time comes 😬😬

You cleared JEE,
I got recommended.  
You got IIT,
I got NDA. 
You persuaded you degree,
I had the toughest training. 
Your day started at 7 and ended at 5,
Mine started at 4 till 9 and
Some nights also included. 
You had your convocation ceremony,
I had my POP. 
Best company took you and
Best package was awarded,
I was ordered to join my paltan
With 2 stars piped on my shoulders. 
You got a job,
I got a way of life. 
Every eve you got to see your family,
I just wished i got to see my parents soon.  
You celebrated festivals with lights and music,
I celebrated with my comrade in bunkers. 
We both married,
Your wife got to see you everyday,
My wife just wished i was Alive. 
You were sent to business trips,
I was sent on line of control. 
We both returned,
Both wives couldn't control their tears, but
You wiped her but,
I couldn't...
You hugged her but,
I couldn't. 
Because I was lying in the coffin,
With medals on my chest and,
Coffin wrapped with tricolour. 
My way of life ended...
Your continued. 

We both left home at 18 🇮🇳

[11/05/17, 5:08:44 PM] ~ Phan!: Someone had been to Laddakh for a week long family trip. 
Their local driver was 28 years old chap named Jigmet. 
Jigmet's family consist of his parents, wife and two small girls. 

This was the conversation with Jigmet, during their journey in deep Himalayan Ranges. 

Prashant -: At the end of this week tourist season in Laddakh will end. Are you planning to go to Goa, the way Nepali Workers from Hotels do ? 

Jigmet -: No, I am local Laddakhi, so I won't go any where in winter. 

Prashant -:What work will you do in winter ? 

Jigmet -: Nothing, will sit quietly at home ( chuckles and winks ) 

Prashant -: For six months, up to next April ? 

Jigmet -: I have one option for working. It's to go to Siachen. 

Prashant -: Siachen ? What will you do there ? 

Jigmet -: Work as Loader for Indian Army. 

Prashant -: You mean, you will join Indian Army as Jawan ? 

Jigmet -: No, I have crossed the age limit to join the Army. This is a contract job for Indian Army. With my few friends, also drivers, I will travel 265 kilometers to Siachen Base camp, My medical examination will be done there to check, if I am fit enough for this job. If I am declared fit, then Army will issue us uniforms, shoes, warm clothing, helmets, etc, We will have to walk up mountains for 15 days to reach Siachen. There is no motorable road to reach Siachen. We will work there for 3 months. 

Prashant -: What work will you do ? 

Jigmet -: It is of loader. To carry load on our back from one chowki to other in Siachen. All supplies are airdropped there. We do the job of picking it up and carrying it to Chowkis. 

Prashant -: Why doesn't the army use Mules or vehicles for shifting of loads ? 

Jigmet -: Siachen is a glacier. Trucks or other vehicles will not work there. Ice scooters make too much of sound, which will attract attention from enemy around there. Use of vehicle will result in firing from other side.We go out in the middle of night, generally around 2 am and pick up loads silently and bring back to barracks. We can't even use a torch. Mules or horses cannot be used because at the altitude of 18875 feet, in winter temperature of minus 50 no animal will survive. 

Prashant -: How can you lift load on your back where oxygen levels are low ? 

Jigmet -: we carry maximum 15 kgs at a time. and we work maximum for 2 hours in a day. Rest of the time is for recouping. 

Prashant -: That is very risky 

Jigmet -: Many of my friends died there. Some of them fell in bottomless crevasses. Some got shot down by enemy bullets. The biggest danger we have in Siachen is of frost bites, but it's rewarding, We are paid Rs 18000/- per month. Since all expenses are taken care of, we can save around Rs 50000/- in these three months. This money is precious for my family, for my daughter's education.and finally I have feeling that I am serving the Army, which means my nation. 

😥🙏🙏  the value of money and the life we have can be better understood after this exchange.
*Do not forget to share this with your children. Let them realise the value of hard earned money.*
Totally humbling.🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
[11/05/17, 6:28:41 PM] Abhijeet Singh Rathod: Do You know why *Men* are called *Husband* and *Women* called *Wives* after marriage?

Ans:

In House, the *Men* has to bend too much in front of Wives to run the family smooth. So they called *House Bend* this slowly changed to *Husband*.
 
The *Women* never trust their Men and asked too many questions that's made them to *Whys*, This slowly changed to *Wives*.

* Death is the number 1 killer in the world.

* Life is sexually transmitted.

* Good health is merely the slowest possible rate at which one can die.

 * All of us could take a lesson from the weather. It pays no attention to criticism.
* Life is like a jar of mirchi chutney. What you enjoy today might burn your ass tomorrow.

...and as someone recently said to me: Don't worry about old age; it doesn't last that long.

However, in a linguistic conference, held in London England, Sun Sherman an Indian American, was the clever winner.   His final challenge was this. His response was: When you marry the right woman, you are 'Complete.' If you marry the wrong woman, you are 'Finished.' And , when the right woman catches you with the wrong woman, you are 'Completely Finished.'  His answer  received a five minute standing ovation._

[02/11/17, 9:34:14 AM] Vamshider Reddy: Where did u see me budd
[02/11/17, 9:34:30 AM] Vikram: exactly :)
[02/11/17, 9:59:01 AM] Rahul Gajula: Wow that's great
[02/11/17, 10:02:34 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: thats great
[02/11/17, 10:02:47 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: He lives near my old house in Madhuranagar.
[02/11/17, 10:04:34 AM] Subba Rao BVB: 👌🏼
[02/11/17, 10:06:56 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: And while I was there, I used to bump into him quiet regularly. (Till 2015). After we moved to kondapur, this is the first time I am seeing him
[02/11/17, 10:47:38 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Yes..I met him in a restaurant in vengal rao Nagar today morning. He came to take break fast
[02/11/17, 10:48:18 AM] Suhail Ambrose: He dint remember me at first though I was his neighbour for 6 to 8 yrs..but later he recognised
[02/11/17, 10:52:25 AM] Subba Rao BVB: It's been long I guess and hence he couldn't recognise you
[02/11/17, 10:52:43 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Talking him was dipressing..he kept talking about taking care of aged parents and also told stories related to the same. He has been staying with his wife alone for almost three decades without moral and physical support from his kids. 
Seamed as if life was tough for him and his wife. I mean not financially but they probably need physical help
[02/11/17, 10:53:34 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Sad to hear but that is the state of affairs these days mostly
[02/11/17, 10:53:41 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Yes.. He was travelling to US till his wife was able to travel. Now he is not travelling.
[02/11/17, 10:54:07 AM] Suhail Ambrose: He has two children and 4 grand children all settled abroad since long. Sir and aunty visit them for small stints now and then
[02/11/17, 10:55:44 AM] Suhail Ambrose: I have his number..will check if he is in WhatsApp and add him to the telegram group
[02/11/17, 10:56:46 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: I used to go to his house occasionally and asked his help several times to get admissions for known people in BVB Jublie Hills
[02/11/17, 10:57:31 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: After his retirement, he still served BVB as some Academic Member or one of those board positions at BVB Kendra and visit schools in Hyderabad regularly.
[02/11/17, 10:58:41 AM] Suhail Ambrose: That's nice..we shouldn't  hesitate calling them now and then. I was surprised when he kept on talking irrelevant things..but that's comes with age..so I understood🤔
[02/11/17, 11:02:44 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: I have no clue about other principals, but VSN was a good guy. I remember all the pranks @919885078965 played on him
[02/11/17, 11:02:56 AM] Vikram: Hahaha
[02/11/17, 11:03:13 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: You remember stealing from his office.
[02/11/17, 11:03:17 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: ???
[02/11/17, 11:03:26 AM] Vikram: I removed his signature very distinctly and Hittu was a master of copying it
[02/11/17, 11:03:45 AM] Vikram: Yes! How can one forget that
[02/11/17, 11:03:46 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: For both🤣😜
[02/11/17, 11:04:02 AM] Vikram: *remember
[02/11/17, 11:06:05 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: While I was in India, I also happened to talk to Rani Madam at her new school.
[02/11/17, 11:08:13 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: I had to wait for 40 minutes before I got to get into her office. But then she spent good time with me. Looks like she is doing extremely good with the school and BVB Kendra in general and she was happy professionally. For some reason, she wanted no mention of NIRD or NIRD School at all.
[02/11/17, 11:11:29 AM] Srikanth Palle: Yup agree that he was a really nice guy!
[02/11/17, 11:12:47 AM] Vikram: I just remembered he made us do income tax problem in 10th
[02/11/17, 11:13:08 AM] Vikram: And does anyone remember his grandsons name?
[02/11/17, 11:27:29 AM] Srikanth Palle: Hritik Krishna I guess
[02/11/17, 11:27:53 AM] Vikram: Correct 💯
[02/11/17, 11:28:17 AM] Srikanth Palle: VSN Hritik Krishna, To be precise
[02/11/17, 11:51:48 AM] Srikanth Palle: https://www.uber.com/en-IN/blog/ride-passes-india/
[02/11/17, 11:53:12 AM] Srikanth Palle: ^@919885078965
[02/11/17, 11:53:54 AM] Srikanth Palle: Also fo those who use or wish to use uber regularly in Hyd .... this looks like a good offer
[02/11/17, 11:54:57 AM] Vikram: Haha
[02/11/17, 11:55:11 AM] Vikram: This is good. I will ask Rajani to buy it
[02/11/17, 11:55:32 AM] Vikram: Srikanth, how is your leg now?
[02/11/17, 12:01:04 PM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: may be this weekend we should do a google hangout session
[02/11/17, 12:01:31 PM] Vikram: I’m in!
[02/11/17, 12:05:02 PM] Suhail Ambrose: I am going to Thailand this weekend
[02/11/17, 12:05:17 PM] Subba Rao BVB: Cool

[06/01/18, 1:21:09 AM] Abhijeet Singh Rathod: During a company's annual family trip to a crocodile farm in Thailand... the eccentric Boss dared any of his employees to jump into the crocodiles infested pond... and swim to the shore.

Anyone who survived the swim will be rewarded with 5 million... but if killed by the crocs...2 million will be given to the next of kin.

For a long period of time no one dared take up the challenge... then suddenly a man jumped in...and swam frantically for his life towards shore pursued by the crocs...and luckily he made it unscathed.

When he managed to recover his breath... the man, who became instant millionaire, shouted asking who pushed him into the pond..... it was his wife who did it.!!!

And from that day...that was how the phrase... "Behind every successful man...there's a woman"...came about !!!😜🤣

[21/01/18, 2:55:40 AM] Abhijeet Singh Rathod: Someone was traveling to Dubai. Unfortunately he was carrying a packet of Khas Khas which is a commonly used spice in some Desi curries and sweets. Khas Khas is also known as poppy seed (Posta Dana)
which can be sprouted to grow narcotics (afeem etc.).
This innocent person did not know that recently the laws in UAE and other Gulf countries have been revised and carrying Khas Khas is punishable with minimum 20 years of imprisonment or even worse with death penalty. Currently, the person is in a jail in Dubai for the last two weeks. His friends are frantically trying hard for his release but are finding that this has become a very very serious case. Lawyers are asking huge fees amounting to AED 100,000 even to appear in the court to plead for his innocence. Please forward this to all you know specially They should know the seriousness of this matter and should never ever carry even minutest quantities of the following items when traveling to Gulf countries:
1. Khas Khas whether raw, roasted or cooked.
2. Paan
3. Beetle nut (supari and its products, e.g. Paan Parag etc.)

The penalties are very severe and it could destroy the life of an innocent person. I appeal to you to create awareness by forwarding this to all you know.

[30/03/18, 11:47:24 AM] Sandeep Vallapu: Loved this: Back in the days when Germany was divided, a huge wall separated East and West Berlin. 

One day, some people in East Berlin took a truck load of garbage and dumped it on the West Berlin side.

The people of West Berlin could have done the same thing, but they didn't. Instead they took a truck load of canned goods, bread, milk and other provisions, and neatly stacked it on the East Berlin side.

On top of this stack they placed the sign:

 *“EACH GIVES WHAT HE HAS"*

How very true! You can only give what you have.

What do you have inside of you? Is it hate or love? 
Violence or peace? 
Death or life?
capacity to build or capacity to destroy?

What have you acquired over the years?

*"EACH GIVES WHAT HE HAS"*

Think about it!

Have A Lovely Day.........

[12/07/18, 10:28:56 PM] Rahul Gajula: *Superb story writen by Chetan Bhagat in his FB Post*

Must read 👌👌

One night, just before *the shopkeeper was* about to close the shop, *a dog came* into the shop.
*There was a bag* in its mouth. *The bag had a list* of items *to be bought* and money. *The shopkeeper took the money* and *kept the items* in the bag.
Immediately, *The dog picked up the bag* of items and *left.* The *shopkeeper was surprised* and *went behind the dog* to see *who the owner was.*
*The dog waited* at the bus stop. After sometime, *a bus came* and the *dog got into* the bus. As soon as *the conductor came,* it *moved forward* to show his neck belt which *had money and the address* as well. *The conductor took* the money and *put the ticket* in his neck belt again.
When *it reached* the destination, *the dog went* to the front and *wagged his tail* indicating that *he wanted* to get down. The moment the bus stopped, *it got down.* The *shopkeeper was still following* it.
*The dog knocked* on the door of a house with its legs. *Its owner came* from inside and *beat* it with a stick.
The shocked shopkeeper *asked* him "why are you beating the dog?", to which *the owner replied,* "he *disturbed* my sleep. *It could have taken* the keys with it."
*This is* the truth of life. *There is* no end to the expectations people have from you. The moment you *go wrong,* they *start pointing* at our mistakes. All the good done in the past is forgotten. Any small mistake committed then *gets magnified.* *This is* the nature of this material world.!!!  👍👍👍
Share the maximum, educate the world!!!

[03/08/18, 3:20:30 AM] Abhijeet Singh Rathod: When you are bored just think about a few things that don't make sense ...like ;
🤔

1. If poison expires, is it more poisonous or is it no longer poisonous?
🤔

2. Which letter is silent in the word "Scent," the S or the C?
🤔

3. Do twins ever realize that one of them is unplanned?
🤔

4. Why is the letter W, in English, called double U? Shouldn't it be called double V?
🤔

5. Maybe oxygen is slowly killing you and It just takes 75-100 years to fully work.
🤔

6. Every time you clean something, you just make something else dirty.
🤔

7. The word "swims" upside-down is still "swims"
🤔

8. 100 years ago everyone owned a horse and only the rich had cars. Today everyone has cars and only the rich own horses.
🤔

9. If you replace "W" with "T" in "What, Where and When", you get the answer to each of them.
🤔
Six great confusions still unresolved 😄😂

1. At a movie theatre, which arm rest is yours?

2. If people evolve from monkeys, why are monkeys still around?

3. Why is there a 'D' in fridge,

but not in refrigerator?

4.  Who knew what time it was when the first clock was made?

And now sixer ....


Vagaries of English Language! Enjoy!!!😀😀😀

- Wonder why the word funeral starts with FUN?

-Why isn't a Fireman called a Water-man?

- How come Lipstick doesn't do what it says?

- If money doesn't grow on trees, how come Banks have Branches?

- If a Vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a Humanitarian eat?

- How do you get off a non-stop Flight?

- Why are goods sent by ship called CARGO and those sent by truck SHIPMENT?

- Why do we put cups in the dishwasher and the dishes in the Cupboard?

- Why do doctors 'practice' medicine? Are they having practice at the cost of the patients?

- Why is it called 'Rush Hour' when traffic moves at its slowest then?

- How come Noses run and Feet smell?

- Why do they call it a TV 'set' when there is only one?

- What are you vacating when you go on a vacation?

We can never find the answers, can we?

So just enjoy the pun and fun of the English language!!

 Pakistan Is A Cemetery For Pakistanis:

"When a Pakistani becomes rich, his bank accounts are in Switzerland. He travels to London/ America for Medical treatment.

He invests in Uk/ Dubai. He buys from Dubai. He consumes Chinese. He prays in Rome or Mecca. His children study in Europe. He travels to Canada, USA, Europe for tourism.

If he dies,  he will be buried in his native country of Pakistan.

Pakistan is just a cemetery for Pakistanis. How could a cemetery be developed?"

~ Putin Asks!

[01/12/18, 9:24:56 AM] Vamshider Reddy: UIDAI emphasised that the said 18003001947 is not a valid UIDAI Toll free number and some vested interest are trying to create unwarranted confusion in the public. UIDAI’s valid Toll free number is 1947 which is functional for more than the last two years. UIDAI has reiterated that it has not asked or advised anyone including any telecom service providers or mobile manufacturers or Android to include 18003001947 or 1947 in the default list of public service numbers.

[27/05/19, 1:45:05 PM] Vikramaditya Singh: An excerpt for PM Modi's ongoing speech at Kaashi... "log bharat Mata ki Jai bolte hain aur uske turant baad banarsi paan kha kar wahin thook dete hain...yeh kis prakar ka jai ... apni maa ko kaun Ganda karta hai ".. this is the thank you speech of PM and look at his drive to get the message of swachta across to the very people who voted for him ... his vision of 75 yrs of independence ... not a bhakt but saying that these sort of statements does show a drive and attitude to make a difference ...

[01/06/19, 3:58:10 PM] Vikram: Camilla, the Duchess of  Cornwall  bought new shoes for her wedding, but they were a size smaller than her actual size...... 

During the big day, they became increasingly tighter and tighter as the day went on. 

That night, when the festivities were finally over,and they retired to their room, she flopped on the bed and said,

"Charles, darling, please remove my shoes, 

my feet are killing me!" 
 


Her ever-obedient Prince of Wales attacked her right shoe with vigour,
but it would not budge. 
 


"Harder!" yelled Camilla, "Harder". 
 

Charles yelled back.
"I'm trying, darling!  But it's just so bloody tight!" 


"Come on! Give it all you've got!" she cried. 



Finally, when it released,
Charles let out a big groan and Camilla exclaimed,

"There! Oh, God, that feels so good!" 



In their bedroom next door, the Queen said to Prince Phillip,

"See!  I told you..... with a face like that, she had to be a virgin!" 


Meanwhile, as Charles tried to remove her left shoe, he cried, "Oh, God, darling! This one's even tighter!"   
 

At which Prince Phillip said to the Queen, 

"That's my boy! He served in the Navy........ 
once a Rear Admiral, always a Rear Admiral!"

😜😜😜

[27/07/19, 6:27:28 PM] Vikram: What is Stress ??

A beautiful girl asks lift from you.

On the way she suddenly falls sick.

You take her to Hospital.

Doctor says : "Congratulations, you're gonna become a Daddy''.

Now you are under Stress.

You say, "No, am not the Father".

But the girl insists that you are the Father. 

Now you're under some serious Stress..😱😨 

Police comes and conducts Medical Tests.

After the test, it is proved that you are not the father and moreover you can never become a Father....😫😱😰 . . . 

That's some more really really serious Stress.

But still you thank God and walk out.

And suddenly you remember you've two kids at home.

And think, if you cannot become a father then whose kids are they ??

🤔Now that is REAL STRESS...😂😂

[10/08/19, 5:14:08 PM] Suhail Ambrose: Do you still remember those awkward days in schools during Exams ?

When a bright student tells the invigilator that question 4 has a problem, but you have already answered it...😳😜

When a fellow student asks for a graph paper, but you are finished and did not see anywhere where it was required...😧 😁😁

When the invigilator says jump question 6 we will rectify it later, but it was the question you enjoyed most when answering...😟 😱😲

When you see people busy using rulers and you are wondering what is going on...😣😫😫

When you hear your friends arguing after the exam whether the answer to question 5 was 35.5% or 36.5% and your answer was 1800 😩😏

The cream. When the other students asked for 4-5 additional answer sheets and You had two pages empty in the main answer sheet😨😰😱

See where you have reached in life inspite of those moments...things are not permanent...enjoy life! 😃😃

Only for those who enjoyed their school life😂😂😂

I think its the need of the hour to Johnnie Walk to Cheeku's Mansion House at 8 PM to discuss about this Aristocratic Premium rule. Nothing is Black and White and we need to throw a Royal Challenge to the King's and Chivas Regals and bring back the Magic Moments of this Bombay Sapphire. All the Bagpipers and Grey Goose following this so called Old Monk creating Absolut White Mischief should have proper Teachers. They can't have their way Four Seasons and it can't always be the Officer's Choice. We definitely don't  want to be another Jagermeister 😂😂

[25/02/20, 2:41:11 PM] Vikram: A young, well qualified Officer left the job, emigrated to Canada for better prospects and applied for a salesman's job at Vancouver's premier downtown department store. It was the biggest store in the world: you could get anything there.

The boss asked him, "Have you ever been a salesman before?"

"Yes sir, I was a salesman in India. 
The boss liked him and said, "You can start tomorrow. Learn fast and do well."

The first working day was long and arduous for the young man, but he got through it.

Finally 6 pm came around. The boss duly fronted up and asked, "How many sales did you make today?"

"Sir, I made ONE sale!" said the young salesman rather happily.

"Only one sale?!" shot back the boss. "No! No! You see, most of my staff make 20 or 30 sales a day.

If you want to keep this job, you'd better be doing better than just one sale.

By the way, how much was your sale worth?"

"$933,005," said the man.

"What?! How did you manage that?" asked the flabbergasted boss.

"Well," said the salesman, "this man came in and I sold him a small fish hook, then a medium hook and finally a really large hook.

Then I sold him a good fishing rod and some fishing gear.

Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast.

So I told him he'd be needing a boat, so I took him down to the boat department and sold him that 20-foot schooner with the twin engines.

Then he said his Volkswagen wouldn't be able to carry it, so I took him to our automotive department and sold him that new Deluxe 4X4 Blazer.

I then asked him where he'll be staying and since he had not decided, I took him to camping department and sold him a six-sleeper camper tent.

Then he said I should throw in about $200 worth of groceries and two cases of beer."

The boss took two steps back and asked in astonishment, "You sold all that to a guy who came in for a fish hook?!"

"No, sir," answered the young man, "he came in to buy a headache relief tablet and I convinced him that fishing is the best remedy for headache."

Boss: "Where did you work?!"

[13/03/20, 12:51:41 AM] Srikanth Palle: FORWARDING THIS NICE WRITE UP:-

The hustle and bustle of China finally quieted down, the restless society finally calmed down, and the restless Chinese people gradually calmed down.
         The *Wild Animals* that were once held by humans in cages finally managed to *Keep Humans in "Cages"*
         Humans finally lowered their proud head and begun to think quietly: Are we still the king of the earth? *Mankind finally felt the power of Nature once again*
         In the face of the threat of death, human beings have only begun to reflect seriously, only to realize that a lack of awe-inspiring social atmosphere will lead to more harm and more risks.
         The greedy heart is being purified by the virus, and the mouth that loves to eat is being punished by the virus. The people who have been soaking in the bright red and green places all day have been driven home by the virus, saying.... *Go home*
         There are fewer and fewer people on the street, few cars on the road,
*The Air is getting Fresher...., the Haze is gone..., the Sky is getting Bluer...., the Sun is getting Brighter...., Family Lives are getting Warmer, Harmonial, and Cordial and People's hearts have become more and more Calm*
         People who haven’t read for Years have picked up books at home. Parents and children who had no communication with their children, couples who couldn’t speak few words a year have opened up the conversation box. Children who did not know how to respect the elderly has also begun to be filial.
         The virus taught human beings a vivid and profound lesson. It made us understand awe. It also let us know what is called *"Good Times"*. It also made us feel true love on earth. It made us gradually fall in love  *"Return to the Road"*, we really should be grateful for this *"Enemy"*, we need such an "enemy" to give us *Reminder"* and give us *"Empowerment"*
         The virus will not leave so quickly, it needs to see the *"Cultivation" of human's good habits*, and the virus will not continue to rag, because *Human love will gather more power* to keep the virus away, time will tell us everything, Time will also prove what is right.

[24/03/20, 11:55:08 AM] Vamshider Reddy: *Please think over it.

(1) Who is bringing Indians from outside : 
IAF and much maligned Air India 
Not Indigo, Vistara or Spice Jet. 

(2) Who is checking people at Arrival : 
Govt servants.
Not private employees or IT packaged earners .

(3) Who is manning isolation centres : 
Defence services and govt health workers and government hospitals.
Not private luxury hospitals .

(4) Who is working day and night even when Gods have shut their places : 
Govt doctors and health workers 
Not private 6 digit salary 
earners .

(5) Now the question is-
*Where is the Private Sector ?*
Has any big corporate come forward to pitch in? 
Has any pvt airline volunteered.
Has any private hospital chain deputed doctors. 
Have they opened quarantine centres? 

In fact, *many Pvt corporates* are even not willing to let people work from home, let alone come forward to take responsibility of disinfecting at least their areas - but waiting for govt to do it! 

Delhi govt had to issue directives for establishments and outlets to keep mundane things like sanitizers at entry. 

*And we always support the Private sector and criticise the Govt at every step.*😥

*Government employees doing there duties so always support them*....👍

*If in future if everything is privatised ..*
*No one will come forward to save you..*☠️
*Be responsible citizen and support Government employees in this critical situation..*

Feel like shared. 
Hence Shared. 
Pranaam. To the Original Composer....

[27/03/20, 1:56:18 AM] Vikram: Coronavirus in general causes respiratory infection to humans
[27/03/20, 1:56:21 AM] Srikanth Palle: There is a rumour that it’s a Chinese biological weapon which got leaked somehow
[27/03/20, 1:56:34 AM] Srikanth Palle: The corona virus
[27/03/20, 1:56:42 AM] Srikanth Palle: Or Chinese virus
[27/03/20, 1:56:45 AM] Vikram: So the name corona is not something out of context in the past

[27/03/20, 3:53:10 PM] Srikanth Palle: Can anyone with banking connections confirm this?
[27/03/20, 3:59:12 PM] Vikram: Economic times is a credible news portal
[27/03/20, 3:59:41 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: This is true but isnt applicable for all. Banks will review n enable this only for the ppl affected by COVID-19 (Job loss, Salay cuts etc)
[27/03/20, 3:59:43 PM] Srikanth Palle: Yes but I read through completely
[27/03/20, 3:59:50 PM] Vikram: The 3 months EMI amount would be added to your loan principle

[27/03/20, 4:02:21 PM] Srikanth Palle: I think the best way is to reach out to your banking partners

[27/03/20, 4:04:00 PM] Srikanth Palle: I understood ... don’t expect that to be the right forum
[27/03/20, 4:04:05 PM] Srikanth Palle: But yeah

[27/03/20, 4:06:03 PM] Vikram: How are you guys managing? Do you have groceries stacked up at home?
[27/03/20, 4:07:23 PM] Srikanth Palle: Give us giving special permits for online firms to deliver to home
[27/03/20, 4:07:34 PM] Srikanth Palle: That should help
[27/03/20, 4:08:30 PM] Vikram: I’m finding hard to get wet wipes. I had ordered it online before the shut down
[27/03/20, 4:08:33 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: Iive groceries stocked for next 2 months!

[27/03/20, 4:09:02 PM] Vikram: 👍
[27/03/20, 4:09:24 PM] Srikanth Palle: Veggies - once in 2-3 days some guy comes in an auto or bandi with veggies and we buy it
[27/03/20, 4:09:52 PM] Srikanth Palle: Milk - Sid’s farm
[27/03/20, 4:10:17 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: You should get these from Amazaon in couple of days

[27/03/20, 4:13:32 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: Rjnr!
[27/03/20, 4:13:46 PM] Vikram: Yes sir
[27/03/20, 4:13:56 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: New home left alone
[27/03/20, 4:14:35 PM] Srikanth Palle: Guys, please get the medicines that your family members take on regular basis atleast for 1-2 months
[27/03/20, 4:14:47 PM] Srikanth Palle: Like BP or diabetes or anything that is consumed on regular basis
[27/03/20, 4:16:03 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: Makes sense...good for a month
[27/03/20, 4:16:20 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: Hopefully things should ease out by then
[27/03/20, 4:17:01 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: 🤞
[27/03/20, 4:17:31 PM] Vikram: There might finally be an explanation for why India and Africa haven’t had much cases yet.  Looks like all the malaria infected countries have herd immunity and hence fatality rates are lower.  This is probably also the reason why chloroquine is working as a treatment.  Check out the world infliction maps below for malaria and COVID - mirror image!!!!
[27/03/20, 4:17:55 PM] Vikram: I found this study and correlation very interesting. Hope this turns out to be true
[27/03/20, 4:24:59 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: 👍This map says it all! If not malaria there must must correlation with these countries
[27/03/20, 4:26:41 PM] Vikram: Generally 1st world countries vs 3rd world
[27/03/20, 4:26:53 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: 🤣
[27/03/20, 4:27:06 PM] Vikram: Comparatively we have better immunity
[27/03/20, 4:27:21 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: Ofcourse!
[27/03/20, 4:27:23 PM] Srikanth Palle: I can think of two reasons
[27/03/20, 4:27:44 PM] Srikanth Palle: Malaria drugs are showing good results on covid19
[27/03/20, 4:28:18 PM] Srikanth Palle: So areas with malaria already are used to that drug or taken it sometime
[27/03/20, 4:28:31 PM] Srikanth Palle: Second striking factor is geography
[27/03/20, 4:29:03 PM] Srikanth Palle: Countries closer to equator - tropical climate are less prone to covid than the ones farther
[27/03/20, 4:29:19 PM] Srikanth Palle: May be to do with the heat or humidity?
[27/03/20, 4:29:29 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: Australia?
[27/03/20, 4:29:52 PM] Vikram: There may be. Even Russia was not effected...its a cold cold country
[27/03/20, 4:29:56 PM] Srikanth Palle: When you talk about it most of the Australians live in the south
[27/03/20, 4:30:10 PM] Srikanth Palle: All major cities except one are on south
[27/03/20, 4:30:23 PM] Srikanth Palle: So usually when we say Australiai it’s these who are over represented
[27/03/20, 4:30:36 PM] Vikram: Extreme temperatures seems like stopping the spread
[27/03/20, 4:30:45 PM] Srikanth Palle: Central and north is mostly uninhabited by humans
[27/03/20, 4:30:52 PM] Vikram: Anyone following Donald trumps daily briefings?
[27/03/20, 4:30:59 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: Yeah
[27/03/20, 4:31:13 PM] Vikram: He is absolutely ruthless and calls it as Chinese virus every day
[27/03/20, 4:31:15 PM] Srikanth Palle: Not daily but I saw when they made announcements about the malaria +some other drug
[27/03/20, 4:31:21 PM] Srikanth Palle: Working on covid 19
[27/03/20, 4:31:25 PM] Vikram: Now, even his team is calling it as Chinese virus
[27/03/20, 4:31:29 PM] Srikanth Palle: Clinical trains are on
[27/03/20, 4:31:35 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: His statements are changing as well everyday!
[27/03/20, 4:31:36 PM] Srikanth Palle: Even I like that
[27/03/20, 4:31:50 PM] Srikanth Palle: Chinese could have stopped all this from happening
[27/03/20, 4:32:06 PM] Srikanth Palle: I will also call Chinese virus
[27/03/20, 4:32:17 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: I'm furious on the way China handled this situation
[27/03/20, 4:32:52 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: There is nothing worong in calling it as China Virus
[27/03/20, 4:33:13 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: Wrong*
[27/03/20, 4:34:05 PM] Srikanth Palle: They are like memu pothey andarni thesko potham
[27/03/20, 4:34:33 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: Diseases were called out by its originated place in the past as well
[27/03/20, 4:34:38 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: Spanish flu
[27/03/20, 4:34:44 PM] Srikanth Palle: That’s true
[27/03/20, 4:34:52 PM] Srikanth Palle: Logic tho kottinav
[27/03/20, 4:35:01 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: 🤣
[27/03/20, 4:35:04 PM] Srikanth Palle: Emotion kadu
[27/03/20, 4:35:29 PM] Vikram: China is blocking to discuss Chinese virus in UN with help of Russia
[27/03/20, 4:36:25 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: True...it has got the power now as well...it is its turn to Chair/Lead the UN now
[27/03/20, 4:38:04 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: Entire world knows that China is deliberately not bringing it up in the UN but strangley rest of the UN members are mum on this!
[27/03/20, 4:39:21 PM] Vikram: That’s how diplomacy works
[27/03/20, 4:40:02 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: Sad...not the WOW of current generation
[27/03/20, 4:40:10 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: Ways of working
[27/03/20, 4:41:43 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: https://youtu.be/T54qSVOc0Ao

[27/03/20, 11:53:38 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: Very grim news coming from head of Covid task force.  India has entered stage 3, it means it's everywhere, no way to contain or isolate. COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION IS AFOOT  
The next 10 days it incubates and explodes.
DONT GO OUT TO BUY ANYTHING, MANAGE WITH WHAT YOU HAVE FOR NEXT WEEK.  ITS BETTER TO THINK NOTHING IS AVAILABLE EXCEPT COVID.
BE VERY AFRAID, BE CAREFUL.  THE COVID JOKE TIME IS OVER.

[27/03/20, 11:57:19 PM] Vikram: This is scary but is based on a single doctors opinion. We are yet to see community spread cases. May be I’m just optimist
[28/03/20, 12:18:46 AM] Sandeep Vallapu: Yeah but it's best not to step out for couple of weeks since the positive cases are increasing and we haven't done enough tests to know the actual status!

[29/03/20, 11:51:33 PM] Sindhu Preetham: Are my testicles black?

A suspected Covid-19 male patient is lying in bed in the hospital, wearing an oxygen mask over his mouth and nose. A young student female nurse appears and gives him a partial sponge bath. 
"Nurse,"' he mumbles from behind the mask, "are my testicles black?"
Embarrassed, the young nurse replies, "I don't know, Sir. I'm only here to wash your upper body and feet."
He struggles to ask again, "Nurse, please check for me. Are my testicles black?"
Concerned that he might elevate his blood pressure and heart rate from worrying about his testicles, she overcomes her embarrassment and
pulls back the covers.
She raises his gown, holds his manhood in one hand and his testicles gently in the other.
She looks very closely and says, "There's nothing wrong with them, Sir. They look fine."
The man slowly pulls off his oxygen mask, smiles at her, and says very slowly,
"Thank you very much. That was wonderful. Now listen very,
very, closely:
"Are - my - test - results - back?"

[31/03/20, 11:52:16 AM] Sandeep Vallapu: The things that COVID 19 made clear 👁👁

1. United States 🇺🇸 is no longer the world's leading country.
2. China 🇨🇳 won the 3rd world war without firing a missile and no one could handle it.🤦🏾‍♂
3. Vladímir Putin 🇷🇺 is a visionary.
4. Prevention saves more lives than acting at the last moment 🧐.
5. Health professionals 👨🏻‍⚕🧑🏻‍⚕👩🏻‍⚕🩺🏥 are worth more than a footballer⚽.
6. Europeans are not as educated as they appear 💶.
7. We are not mistaken when we ask for more hospitals "and less war".
8. Children👧🏻🧒🏻 occupy a privileged place in nature.
9. Oil 🛢 is worthless in a society without consumption.
10. Death does not distinguish race, color, or social strata 👩🏻👨🏻‍🦱👩🏼‍🦰👳🏼‍♂👩🏿‍🦲.
11. Human beings are opportunistic and despicable, no matter their socioeconomic position when raising prices 😒.
12. Toilet paper 🧻 is more important than food.
13. Social networks 🤳🏼 bring us closer, but it is also the means to create panic 👿.
14. Now we know how animals feel in zoos.
15. Today's children no longer know how to play without internet or TV🧸🎈🤗.
16. There are those who earn millions💰 and do not serve humanity.
17. A computer engineer 💻 is important, he already knows where the internet fell.
18. Health care workers👨🏻‍⚕👩🏻‍⚕🩺 are alone, abandoned and forgotten. Even so, they never give up💪🏽.
19. Children are now educated as free thinkers by their parents🖐🏼.
20. Does aid favor the wealthy💰, and the needy? Those who live day by day are disoriented.
21. No Peer/pastor/Pandit saved coronavirus patients 🦠.
22. We started to appreciate the great gesture of trust that means shaking hands are not necessary🤝.
23. Humans👱🏻👩🏼‍🦰👳🏼‍♂👩🏾‍🦱 are the real vírus viruses on the planet.
24. The planet 🌍 regenerates quickly without humans.
25. We are not prepared for a pandemic
26. Politicians take the opportunity to pull the rug from the rival.
27. More should be invested in health rather than festivals.

A little BIG reflection 😒😒🙄🙄

[11/04/20, 4:27:25 PM] Srikanth Palle: They are islands and mostly anti China
[11/04/20, 4:27:35 PM] Srikanth Palle: May be that is the reason not much in contact with them
[11/04/20, 4:28:16 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: Yeah..that sounds right
[11/04/20, 4:33:24 PM] Vamshider Reddy: Some theories say that China has interest in owning some multinational companies which are established in their country by owning majority stake so they might have created a someykind synthetic virus
[11/04/20, 4:35:03 PM] Srikanth Palle: Not sure this is because of business reasons but for sure they were experimenting on some biological weapons os what I heard
[11/04/20, 4:36:24 PM] Vamshider Reddy: I think it could be possible that China might have antidote if it was created

[11/04/20, 4:41:50 PM] Vamshider Reddy: But just think if china announces that it was successfully to create antidote before any other country would India still believe and purchase it?
[11/04/20, 4:42:06 PM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: If it reaches a stage where it is spreading fast, imagine the state of our health care

...मै गुजरे पल को सोचूँ 
   तो, कुछ दोस्त 
   बहुत याद आते हैं....
 
_...अब जाने कौन सी नगरी में,_
_...आबाद हैं जाकर मुद्दत से....😔_

....मै देर रात तक जागूँ तो ,
    कुछ दोस्त 
    बहुत याद आते हैं....

....कुछ बातें थीं फूलों जैसी,
....कुछ लहजे खुशबू जैसे थे,
....मै शहर-ए-चमन में टहलूँ तो,
....कुछ दोस्त बहुत याद आते हैं.

_...सबकी जिंदगी बदल गयी,_
_...एक नए सिरे में ढल गयी,_😔

_...किसी को नौकरी से फुरसत नही..._
_...किसी को दोस्तों की जरुरत नही...._😔

_...सारे यार गुम हो गये हैं..._
...."तू" से "तुम" और "आप" हो गये है....

....मै गुजरे पल को सोचूँ 
    तो, कुछ दोस्त बहुत याद आते हैं....

_...धीरे धीरे उम्र कट जाती है..._
_...जीवन यादों की पुस्तक बन जाती है,_😔
_...कभी किसी की याद बहुत तड़पाती है..._
  _और कभी यादों के सहारे ज़िन्दगी कट जाती है ..._😔

....किनारो पे सागर के खजाने नहीं आते, 
....फिर जीवन में दोस्त पुराने नहीं आते...

_....जी लो इन पलों को हस के दोस्त,_😁
    _फिर लौट के दोस्ती के जमाने नहीं आते ...._

Driver:I was driving at 50mph when I saw two men crossing the road. On the roadside, there was a restaurant with outside seating. I wanted to apply the brakes, but I realised they were not working. So I had to take a decision: Either hit the 2 men or run into the restaurant.

Judge: Hit the 2 men of course!

Driver: Exactly! After hitting the first man, the other man ran inside the restaurant so l followed him.

[14/01/21, 4:00:22 PM] Srikanth Palle: Happy Makara Sankranthi!!
[14/01/21, 4:11:13 PM] Srikanth Palle: Trivia: this is called makara (makaram=Capricorn) sankranthi because the Sun is on an upwards movement vis-à-vis earth’s position. Up from the Tropic of Capricorn(makaram). Hence India starts moving closer to sun and in a period of month or month and half its summer. This is also called as uttarayan in Gujarat which also says the same thing that the sun moves towards uttar(north). In truth it’s not the sun moving up but earth’s axis position which makes this happen while earth is revolving around the sun. From earth’s standpoint it feels sun is moving up.
‎[14/01/21, 4:12:31 PM] Srikanth Palle: ‎image omitted
[14/01/21, 4:17:38 PM] Srikanth Palle: Also most of our festivals are based on lunar calendar but not Sankrathi which is based on sun. If interested you can do more research on uttarayan and dakshinayan which causes the cycle of seasons on earth.

[14/01/21, 5:40:26 PM] Vikram: 👍
[14/01/21, 5:44:58 PM] Vikram: Would like to add, we had the shortest day this winter on 21-dec-2020. technically uttarayana started on 21st. About 1500 years ago the shortest day and uttarayana used to coincide but over centuries it has differed due to ‘precession of equinoxes’ not being accounted for. Today we celebrate sankranti on 13/14 jan

[15/02/21, 11:08:20 AM] Srikanth Palle: My observations:
Your acting is good but it’s not complimented well by the script or other folks acting. So my suggestion is start giving auditions for good movies or stories. The videos that usually get high views or become hit are the ones where all actors are good/decent and the script is good.
[15/02/21, 11:09:55 AM] Srikanth Palle: Folks, 
Please update Sravan with any auditions that you might know of for good movies/series.

[24/02/21, 3:10:55 PM] Vikram: Two beggars in London

Ali and Habib are beggars. They beg in different areas of London ...

Habib begs just as long as Ali does, but only collects £2 to £3 every day.

Ali brings home a suitcase FULL of £10 notes, drives a Mercedes, lives in a mortgage-free house and has a lot of money to spend.

Habib asks Ali 'I work just as long and hard as you do but how is it that you bring home a suitcase full of £10 notes every day?'

Ali says, 'Look at your sign, what does it say'?

Habib's sign reads 'I have no work, a wife and 6 kids to support'.

Ali says No wonder you only get £2- £3

Habib says 'So what does your sign say'?

Ali shows Habib his sign. It reads:

'I only need another £10 to move back to Pakistan'.

'MILITARY LOGIC'
A General was visiting the troops at the battlefront

As he walked along the battle line inspecting the soldiers, a sniper bullet whistled by,  overhead

"What the devil was that?" he roared
"It's an enemy sniper, Sir
..He's been shooting at us for about two weeks
We know exactly where he is." 

"Well, then why don't you send someone to take him out?"

"Sir, if we did that, they might replace him with someone who could shoot straight."

PRECISELY THE REASON for No action against Pappu

[11/03/21, 5:27:57 PM] Vikram: A monkey is smoking a joint

A monkey is sitting in a tree, smoking a joint, when a lizard walks past. The lizard looks up and says "Hey! what are you doing?" The monkey says "Smoking a joint, come up and join me" So the lizard climbs up and sits next to the monkey and they have another joint. After a while the lizard says his mouth is 'dry', and that he's going to get a drink from the river. 


At the riverbank, the lizard is so stoned that he leans too far over and falls in. A Crocodile sees this and swims over to the stoned lizard, helping him to the side. 


He then asks the lizard, "What's the matter with you?!" The lizard explains to the crocodile that he was sitting in the tree, smoking a joint with the monkey and his mouth got dry, and that he was so wasted that, when he went to get a drink from the river, he fell in! 

The inquisitive crocodile says he has to check this out. He walks into the jungle and finds the tree where the monkey is sitting, finishing a joint.

IT IS BEING ALLEGED THAT INDIA HAS LOST ITS COVID WAR. IT IS A FAILURE OF MODI SARKAR.

IS IT SO?

Social media is hyped with visuals of capital’s hospitals overwhelmed by the patients and people dying in the corridors and ambulances. There seems to be shortage of everything; beds, doctors, oxygen cylinders, ventilators, etc. as well as empathy and planning. The visuals taken inside and outside the hospitals are really heart-wrenching. The opposition is on a point-scoring spree on the death tally. Even a CM telecast live an in-house meeting to play dirty politics. Channels are crying hoarse. 

That is where India is failing.

INDIA IS MUCH BETTER OFF THAN MOST OF THE WORLD.  

Just look at the figures. It is not about the total deaths. As by today’s reported data, India has 134 deaths/1 million of population. Almost, all the western countries including USA has reported more than 1,500 deaths per million.

Hungary        2,719
Bulgaria         2,276
Belgium         2,056
Italy                1,960
UK                  1,868
Brazil              1,795
USA                1,757
Poland            1,711
Portugal         1,667
Spain              1,657
France            1,562
Romania         1,417
Sweden          1,368
Switzerland    1,212

INDIA                134.. 

It is 120 in the world in terms of deaths per 1 million. USA with double of the  number of reported cases (compared with India) has 3 times more deaths. Interestingly CHINA is the only major country which has 3 deaths per 1 million of its population. Yes, India has miserably failed compared with China. But then CCP manufacturing sector is very robust. They can manufacture everything, even the Covid figures! 

INDIAN MEDIA AND REPORTING

Do you think that the despair and gloom would have been less in the countries? Obviously no. But no one has seen such gory images of dying patients, wailing attendants, aerial drone shots of crematoriums, shouting news anchors, corpses lined up for burial, honking ambulances, point scoring politicians, sensational news headlines, as if hell has broken lose. Nowhere in the world, press reporters would be reporting directly live from the Covid wards!  Nowhere else the attendants would be attending their loved ones and being interviewed too.  NOBODY in the world has seen the kind of COVID reporting being done in India. That is something which is the worst kind of yellow journalism and must be legally stopped. 

WORST CASE SCENARIO

The casualty figures may get much worse than 134 for India. If the casualty rate is that of SWITZERLAND, the total death count is 17 lac and if it is that of between Italy and Belgium, it would be 34 lac! All I want to reiterate is that it is a Pandemic and the odds are so heavy against poorer nations. Germany has 13 beds for its 1,000 people. Its 13 for Japan, 6 for France, 4.6 for Switzerland, China has 4.3 bed per 1000 people.  UK has 2.5, Canada 2.5,  whereas in India it is 0.5! 

INDIA'S WATERSHED MOMENT

So for every 2,000 people we have one hospital bed. It is also not about medical facilities only. It is about our general attitude towards protection and safety. It is also about the necessity to go out for work. Not everyone has the WFH facility. We have millions of domestic helpers, working from our homes only! Over 90 percent of India's working population is part of the unorganised sector, producing around 60% of India’s GDP, which is in direct contrast with the West. In India, there is no social welfare system or a comprehensive national health system as in the UK, for example. But worst is the political lot. There are no partisan politicians who would do point scoring during a national emergency. Had the opposition and press been so damn bad in the UK a year ago, Boris Johnson has long been history. But no, everyone rallied behind their PM for the national cause. 

The death toll in India is likely to worsen before it gets better. The public at large has to be vigilant as much as possible. With all these heavy odds, whatever the India has done to combat the pandemic is commendable. There has been a wave of philanthropic nationalism. People have come forward to help one another. India has the capacity to combat this pandemic. All what India needs is patriotism, humanism and rallying around your national leadership.

[25/04/21, 10:28:28 PM] Sindhu Preetham: STATE GOVTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OXYGEN SHORTAGE , NOT CENTRE ALONE- HOSPITSLS EQUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR NOT HAVING OXYGEN PLANTS-.
——————————————————
*A Forward on oxygen*

Having spent my life time of 45 years in oxygen industry and involved with setting up 50% of production capacities in india ( as business head of Linde) I can share few things which will probably clear some of your thoughts. First few facts 
1) Industrial and medical oxygen are same product produced in same plant, stored in same tanks and filled in same cylinders. For medical oxygen the gas company just have to analyse each batch and certify. No other difference. In fact for industrial we need 99.5% pure oxygen where as for medical as per pharmocopea  all over world is 93+\-3%.
2) There is absolutely no shortage of oxygen product in india. You will be surprised to know that less than 1% of oxygen production capacity is used for medical purposes. Even in corona times it may go up to three times or even 5%. But that’s it.
2) I would estimate total oxygen production capacity in india to be around 100,000 tons per day ( or may be more) and around  80% of oxygen production capacities are with steel companies where oxygen gas is produced and used in iron making as well as steel making. Yes, Relinace Jamnagar has 22000 tons per day capacity for petcoke gassification. 
3) Most of captive plant are in East india, some in west ( Mumbai and Gujarat) and some in Karnataka. These plants typically produce 5-10% of product as liquid which is stored in large tanks. This liquid is used by them as back up when plant is down and also to meet peak demands. 
4) There are several stand alone liquid oxygen plants owned by gas companies like Linde and Innox where they produce liquid oxygen and sell to various customers through tankers and tanks.   5) Several refillers around country buy liquid from gas companies and fill gas cylinders after vaporising liquid 
6) Oxygen is generally delivered to end user by three means. Directly through pipe line from plant to end user which is say 80% of product. 15% or so is delivered in liquid form through tanks and tankers and less than 5% through cylinders 
*So why are we facing crisis today ?* I think combination of followings 
1) Shortage of distribution assets ie road tankers, storage tanks and cylinders. Mind you these are expensive. Each road tanker costs 45 lakhs on road and a cylinder costs around 10,000 in which you sell oxygen just worth Rs 300. These assets have been built by gas companies based on normal times. There is only that much one can do with these assets 
2) Logistics management. Most of Plants are located in select geographies. So distribution assets travel fair distance ( 200-1000 kms) to deliver to customer. Now even with good roads a tanker takes around 7-10 days to make a round trip and a cylinder also takes that much turn around. 
3) Desire of gas companies to focus on what maximises their profits 
Last but not least this wave came so quick it took our government administration with pants down. Had they thought of this impending danger and prepared, a major crisis could have been avoided. But that’s easy said than done knowing our democratic set up. Now Govt are taking steps. In hindsight I think Govt could have planned followings 
1) Strict advisory to gas companies to use all distribution assets for medical purpose only from day one. They could provide compensation to gas companies for this just like MSP for food grains.
2) Advise all captive plants owners not to use a drop of liquid oxygen from plant / tank for their process use until they are full.
3) Using rails to transport through green door track 
4) All hospitals could have installed PSA captive plants. PMO had announced 200 crores for all district hospitals and they could have around 500 plants. In usual public sector tendering process not even 15% of that has been used 
5) CEO of large hospitals are also equally responsible. When they charge such huge money from public, they should have better prepared them selves. For what they get fat salaries and bonuses. Once this crisis is over I think some heads of CEO of large hospitals must roll.
No more for now. Any one wishes to know more may contact me on one to one basis.
[25/04/21, 10:38:03 PM] Sindhu Preetham: Yogi is spending 1000 crore on Kashi Dham (which is good for pilgrims and should be encouraged for their safety and comfort), but doesn’t have the vision to enhance Oxygen production ( in India’s most populous state). His administration spend time and resources preparing for a Covid super spreader event like the Kumbh Mela, then abruptly canceled it half way because of pressure. India’s second wave is primarily because of the Kumbh Mela, Elections that defied Covid protocols lead by the PM, HM, Opposition, Ramzan events etc).

[30/04/21, 2:30:56 PM] Vikram: ***Not a forward***
Guys, just wanted to share my experience to find a bed for covid patient since today early morning.

One of my Accenture colleague was infected with Covid and last night his oxygen levels fell below 70. He was rushed to a near by hospital but it didn’t have enough oxygen to last the night and also they didn’t have ventilator. Midnight one hospital in hyderabad promised them a bed and they rushed him to hyd. But upon reaching here the bed as not available anymore.

I have been trying my best to find a hospital for him since early morning. I might have called up more than 100 numbers and spoke to all possible leads but there are no luck till 1 pm.
Finally about an hour ago, we were able to find a bed, through one of my friend.

Just want to share with you all, the things are bad beyond our imagination. Guys stay home and stay safe.
[30/04/21, 2:32:30 PM] Srikanth Palle: Sad state of affairs.

“My Covid Recovery Story

Hi everyone i just completed my quarentine period. So want to share my experience on covid. My mom got chills on 14th April once she was back from vijetha, by night she got fever so we gave her dolo 650 but it dint worked. Next morning her temperature reached 104°, unbearable headache and she started vomiting. we were scared and couldn't understand what to do. So, we were giving her sponge bath and ice bath but no recovery at all. By the night i talked to few doctors they told me very positive symptoms of covid then on 15th i get her test done and lucky i got her report by 16th night and it was positive. By god grace one of my friend is doctor she recommended me medicine and asked me to keep checking her temp and SpO2. After taking the medicines her fever dropped and she was feeling much better. Then on the same night i starting feeling uneasy and sour throat so i understood that that i got infected too. So same i got isolated and get my test done next morning and yes it was positive. As i took immediate action i had 100° fever and things were in control with in 2 to 3 days. 

Dont Panic if you are covid positive..
Guys i am not a doctor but a covid survivor. So just want to aware that dont panic but dont even take it easily. Covid is all about timings, if you take immediate action it will be controlled  within 2 days. But you must take medicine properly and a good diet. 

Symptoms i got or we experienced-
1) Chills
2) Sour throat
3) Severe Headache 
4) Unbearable body pain
5) Vomiting
6) Lose of smell and taste
7) Red and itchy eyes

Very Important:
1) First of all dont panic if have any of the symptoms. Covid is cured and controlled if you take immediate action. Please dont delay in thinking that it is normal viral fever.
2) Consult your doctor and take proper medicine.
3) Take eucalyptus steam 4times a day and do gargles with hot water 4times a day.
4) Once there is no fever start doing pranayam- Bhastrika, Kapal bhanti and Anulom vilom.
5) Also if you have cough- add 2-2 drops of shatbindu oil in both the nostrils. It will help in removing cough.
6) If possible play some good positive meditation music and keep yourself calm. It brings positive environment which is very important in such condition. We used to do everyday.

Thats how we recovered from Covid. Hope this will help you guys.  I am not a doctor but as an experienced survivor of covid 19 so whatever help i can give from my side will surely provide. 
Thank You Everyone 
Stay Happy And Healthy. Love Life bcoz we have only one life to live. Live it to the fullest.”

[11/05/21, 11:12:59 PM] Sindhu Preetham: Some thoughts below are from my colleague at IIT and the figures he quoted herein are copied from other sources.

When the country decided to adopt the CovishieId and Covaxin, the intelligentsia, non-BJP political parties, NGOs, all started speaking in the media that there is insufficient data on it’s efficacy, it is fake and we will not get it done.

The media also launched a movement against the Indian vaccine.

During this time, look at the list of how many news / articles were published in the media against the vaccine -

Indian Express-182,
Loksatta-172,
Navbharat Times-236,
Hindustan times -123,
Times of india -28,
The wire -78,
The print -59,
Scroll-122,
Newslundary-54,
Alt news -78,
The hindu -128

Look at the list of how many leaders of the opposition political parties spoke against the vaccine.

Congress Party-58,
Samajwadi Party-17,
Shiv Sena-27,
DMK-13,
CPM-12
TMC-12

The founders and employees of 265 major NGOs had spoken against the vaccine.

172 retired IAS, IPS, judges and other government officials also
had spoken against the vaccine.

342 cartoons were produced by cartoonists in opposition to the vaccine.

After all this, a confusion arose among the large section of the people of the country that vaccine is not safe and hence is not to be taken. And when the vaccination started from 15 January, only a few people used to come to the vaccine centers. 
On a couple of days some vaccination centers reported only 2-3 vaccinations.
If you look at the long lines for vaccines in Mumbai today, hundreds of people above 60 years are also seen.  
Someone may ask them that since March, when there were no crowds and vaccine doses were going waste, why did they not get the vaccination done then? 
Similarly the HCWs and FLWs now queuing up did not want it January onwards when it had opened up exclusively for them. 
The reason are the same fear that these newspapers, politicians etc. had created.

Due to this fear, and vaccination hesitancy several million doses of vaccine were wasted, new orders were delayed, production capacity expansion did not take place and the result is there for all to see.

*Today these same agitators/protestors against the vaccine are going to get vaccinated quietly.*
[12/05/21, 12:50:05 AM] Vikram: Hey Sindhu, I know it may be just a forward, but I would like to put my opinion; I am glad that you are concerned about the plight in India. Still, from your message, it is drafted by some known/unknown colleague of yours who also happens to be from "IIT", and as it looks like the media, NGOs, bureaucracy (rtd), and finally, the opposition has led you guys down.
First, the vaccine drive technically started on 1-Mar and not on 15-Jan. From 15-Jan, it was open for frontline workers only. I am an avid follower of the news (English national news only) of this country, and let me tell you the figures of news articles published against vaccines by your list is INCORRECT. There were murmurs about vaccines but was never reported in the mainstream media; it was mostly limited to online. Please feel free to quote examples if I'm incorrect. As of today, the Modi govt is still reluctant to approve Pfizer, Moderna or J&J. Don't give it for free but at least approve them for commercial emergency use. Can we understand the rationale? if there is any
We would have never avoided the 2nd wave but had the Govt applied LITTLE common sense, we would have been in a much better place.
I am making an effort to write this message to let you know the ground realities and hope you take it in good spirits. Cheers!
[12/05/21, 12:51:44 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: Hey!!  not to counter anyone but rahul gandhi was extremely vocal about not taking the vaccine .. there are several of his statements and antiques on record for the same ...
[12/05/21, 12:55:13 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Just approve Pfizer and allow for commercial emergency use. Lakhs of lifes will be saved.
[12/05/21, 12:55:45 AM] Vikram: Bhai Rahul G is no one in today's political landscape. He is mere a MP. BJP has a robust machinery make to prove him wrong. The people of India have voted Rahul/Congress vovted out in majority. For me it doesnt matter what Rahul/me/or you say here
[12/05/21, 1:00:51 AM] Sindhu Preetham: We can have a nice discussion on who is right and who is wrong, who to blame and who to praise. The future of the world is in the hands of China -- we all are doomed.
[12/05/21, 1:02:07 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Mama even if approved they will not be able to supply till 2022. Also they weren't ready to indemnify against any adverse effects for individuals. Indian govt asked this as they did not do the bridging trials
[12/05/21, 1:03:09 AM] Subba Rao BVB: It's changing and I disagree with future being in hands of China
[12/05/21, 1:03:41 AM] Subba Rao BVB: I believe in India growth story and surely we will be having a say in the coming decades
[12/05/21, 1:04:10 AM] Sindhu Preetham: Modi Govt. did vaccine diplomacy by shipping vaccines abroad, while Biden govt. got more than 40% people vaccinated by restricting exports. Poor judgement and lack of wisdom.
[12/05/21, 1:04:46 AM] Subba Rao BVB: We are a force to reckon in pharma especially in generic pharma which made health care affordable globally
[12/05/21, 1:05:19 AM] Sindhu Preetham: The API for those generic drugs come from China 😜
[12/05/21, 1:05:47 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Agreed but efforts are in place to reduce this dependency
[12/05/21, 1:06:12 AM] Sindhu Preetham: All we do is add binder to the API, sugar coating, and make pellets!!
[12/05/21, 1:06:19 AM] Subba Rao BVB: More companies are focussing on reducing this dependency
[12/05/21, 1:06:54 AM] Subba Rao BVB: I disagree
[12/05/21, 1:08:21 AM] Subba Rao BVB: India population 132 crores vis US population of 32 crores. 40 percent of 32 translate to 12.8 crores which is less than 10  percent of India population
[12/05/21, 1:09:19 AM] Vikram: Friends, these are tough tough times. We should stay together and let’s not fall for the political propaganda. Things on ground is really really bad. 
All im saying is let’s not fall for govt PR and let’s keep questioning and don’t do the govt wah wahi
[12/05/21, 1:09:41 AM] Sindhu Preetham: India and China pretty much started the economic race back in 1990. China will soon overtake US. India leading China is a pipe dream.
[12/05/21, 1:09:50 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Vaccines administered in India is 17 cr roughly
[12/05/21, 1:10:08 AM] Vikram: People are deprived the basic things like O2
[12/05/21, 1:10:24 AM] Subba Rao BVB: I agree we should question the government if something is wrong but not for everything
[12/05/21, 1:10:49 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Like the dual pricing is absolute nonsense with regard to vaccine pricing for state and center
[12/05/21, 1:11:08 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Bottom line being everything being paid by tax payers money
[12/05/21, 1:11:16 AM] Sindhu Preetham: When it comes to vaccine adoption in India, people trust govt. It is opposite (Rednecks don't trust gov.) in the US. US has more idiots.
[12/05/21, 1:11:39 AM] Vikram: Do you know a ventilator consumes about 5-7 times of a person on O2. There isn’t enough O2 and it’s up to the managements decisions save 1 or 5-7. PATHETIC
[12/05/21, 1:12:19 AM] Subba Rao BVB: This is one more thing which I was disheartened
[12/05/21, 1:12:40 AM] Subba Rao BVB: The elections as well during the pandemic times
[12/05/21, 1:12:56 AM] Sindhu Preetham: Glad my forwarded message injected a dose of adrenaline among us 😋

[12/05/21, 1:14:03 AM] Subba Rao BVB: There was some news from IIT Bombay wherein they provided a solution
[12/05/21, 1:14:07 AM] Vikram: But I don’t where is the solution
[12/05/21, 1:14:42 AM] Vikram: Oh great. Can you share a link, if handy
[12/05/21, 1:14:46 AM] Sindhu Preetham: Good. Get some seratonin and go sleep. It is late night.

[12/05/21, 1:15:55 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Making your public trust the solution is one of government responsibilities in my view
[12/05/21, 1:16:01 AM] Vikram: This is on mashable! Will follow the news

[12/05/21, 1:17:18 AM] Subba Rao BVB: This was one more news which I felt proud of the Indian research
[12/05/21, 1:19:01 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Sputnik manufacturing will commence soon. I am also reading that Zycov D vaccine would also be approved
[12/05/21, 1:19:12 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Zycov D from cadilla in June
[12/05/21, 1:19:23 AM] Subba Rao BVB: We see light in the gloomy times
[12/05/21, 1:19:39 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Tech transfer of vaccines is also being looked into
[12/05/21, 1:20:25 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Definitely will be much better placed with regard to vaccine availability in 2 months is what I feel
[12/05/21, 1:20:45 AM] Vikram: I’m hoping the govt approves as many vaccines at the earliest. 
Covaxin was approved in phase 2 trails. 

Let’s approve the others for emergency use at the least to save life’s
[12/05/21, 1:21:47 AM] Subba Rao BVB: I second this but without compromising on person safety 👍
[12/05/21, 1:22:03 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Cadila has already done phase 3 trials

[12/05/21, 1:23:41 AM] Srikanth Palle: Of*

[12/05/21, 1:24:32 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Even more if we are such a densely populated country
[12/05/21, 1:26:09 AM] Vikram: Sure mama. I will listen to this tomorrow
[12/05/21, 1:26:17 AM] Subba Rao BVB: 👍
[12/05/21, 1:27:39 AM] Srikanth Palle: The political opposition currently in India is worse than third grade. We need better standard of opposition.
[12/05/21, 1:27:41 AM] Vikram: At least I’m not blaming for the pandemic. But there are other basic things which govt could/should do; rather than managing perception
[12/05/21, 1:28:02 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Totally agree ra
[12/05/21, 1:28:26 AM] Srikanth Palle: I’m actually amazed at your people have formed groups and supporting each other during this time.
[12/05/21, 1:28:28 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Always would like to have a strong opposition in state or center
[12/05/21, 1:28:48 AM] Srikanth Palle: We as a society have to come together to get through this.
[12/05/21, 1:29:00 AM] Subba Rao BVB: One of the unfortunate things in Telangana as well
[12/05/21, 1:29:05 AM] Srikanth Palle: At how* people
[12/05/21, 1:29:14 AM] Subba Rao BVB: 👍
[12/05/21, 1:29:57 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Vice-versa also true ra. I am loathed at how few folks bare doing the black marketing of life saving drugs
[12/05/21, 1:30:05 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Are*
[12/05/21, 1:30:17 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Especially in these testing times
[12/05/21, 1:31:19 AM] Subba Rao BVB: A vial of remdivisir which is about 900 to 3500 bucks is being sold around 25-50k a few weeks back
[12/05/21, 1:32:05 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Now a decision has been taken to directly supply to hospital which has reduced the black marketing to a certain extent
[12/05/21, 1:32:47 AM] Subba Rao BVB: But drugs such as Toclizumab etc are still being sold at 7-10 times of MRP

[30/05/21, 9:15:53 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: I believe what is being promulgated  is other way around ... wave 1 .. stable not because of modi wave 2  - failure of modi.. even this is an example of same ... stop blaming governance .... it is time to introspect too .be a support in present situtation.. next time do vote and get him out...but right now stand and do the best to get out of this .. spread positivity and hope ..
[30/05/21, 9:19:52 AM] Vikram: I was critical of MMS & the UPA 2 for price raise, corruption, unemployment etc etc. 
But these are unprecedented times but even now our govt is more concerned about public image! Stop spreading fake positivity and call a spade a spade!
[30/05/21, 9:27:54 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: The list of this govt having done good is way too much than any others... this failure would have been met by any governance because the health infra of our country is the doing of all the govts since 1947.. and we know who had the majority on that .. if u enforce lockdown - no economy ... if they ask you to get vaccinated in time  then Modi vaccine will convert you to a hindu fanatic and when u do have to get vaccinated .. then the govt has failed ... money alloted for o2 plants ... state did not implement but it is modi who has sucked all the o2 of the country ... anyways this may not be worth debating over blind hate and personal losses which is driving the emotion right now .. and we are too shortsighted to even see where we have reached in the last 7 years... there are tremendous force across the world to ensure that India doesn't become self reliant ..let us all just play our parts instead of criticizing... anyways I will put it to rest here ..
[30/05/21, 9:34:45 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: Btw I am of the sect worst effected by Modi ... No Pay rise ..  DA not given ... privileges curtailed ... no cadre review for promotional avenues .. all infra and bunglow of army being taken over by state admin ... place of armed forces at all time low in civil hierarchy .. accomplished offrs being superseded and stooges being promoted ..  but still I stick with what I said earlier ..
[30/05/21, 9:35:06 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: Csd being closed😱
[30/05/21, 11:15:40 AM] Vikram: As of today, there are many things the govt could have done correctly in this crises. I can go on and on listing items about the past but leaving that aside. Why are we still charging GST on covid medication, consumables & medical equipment? Why isn’t govt of India procuring vaccines for the country? Why are the states made to compete against each other? When things are getting out of hand, its no longer Modi but the respective state govt’s. 
Why is the media not asking Qns, like they did before 2014? The godi media is hell bent on supporting the govt and shove their narrative into our minds. Nothing is hunky dory. As a citizen, no ideology, politician or party is a friend, especially the ruling one. ✌️
[30/05/21, 11:16:10 AM] Vikram: We need a better opposition in this country of 130B people

To reverse a decision of an IAS officer, the ground reality should be made aware to all the stake holders and then we should fight seriously.

[04/06/21, 12:50:39 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Hmm kk
[04/06/21, 12:50:42 PM] Srikanth Palle: Sputnik is also two doses ... Sputnik lite is the single does one. Don’t know when it’ll be released

[04/06/21, 2:26:33 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Avunaa
[04/06/21, 2:26:35 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: Those who have plans to travel abroad in near future should get Covisheild..other vaccines are not recognised globally yet!
[04/06/21, 2:27:17 PM] Srikanth Palle: +1
[04/06/21, 2:27:20 PM] Vamshider Reddy: Surprising 😮
[04/06/21, 2:27:28 PM] Srikanth Palle: It’s true
[04/06/21, 2:28:02 PM] Vamshider Reddy: But others are  recognized  by who rite?
[04/06/21, 2:28:08 PM] Srikanth Palle: It’s not that you can’t travel but you will have to be in 14 days quarantine in most of the countries
[04/06/21, 2:28:23 PM] Srikanth Palle: Covishield is
[04/06/21, 2:28:53 PM] Srikanth Palle: WHO is only a joke in the first place ... China’s chamchas they are
[04/06/21, 2:29:20 PM] Vamshider Reddy: Wish sputnik will be available soon I believe in Russia

[04/06/21, 2:38:58 PM] Vikram: I was fortunate and had an option to choose vaccine and went with covaxin. Since it is classic vaccine made from inactivated virus itself. Also, the 2nd dose of this is 4 weeks only. I wanted to get it it done sooner then later
[04/06/21, 2:41:19 PM] Vikram: I am hoping covaxine would be recognised soon
[04/06/21, 2:41:51 PM] Vamshider Reddy: Sure that's a good vaccine but the issue is with its availability
[04/06/21, 2:42:33 PM] Vamshider Reddy: Has 70 -80 % efficacy
[04/06/21, 2:44:25 PM] Vikram: Guys my ¢2, whatever is available, just get yourself and your family vaccinated first
[04/06/21, 2:52:25 PM] Vamshider Reddy: Agree but what if we dont get 2nd dose in time
[04/06/21, 2:53:08 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: Agree, those who have a choice and need to travel abroad soon should get Covisheild else get whatever is available...dinner the better!
[04/06/21, 2:53:19 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: Sooner*
[04/06/21, 2:53:36 PM] Vikram: By the end of June I feel we will get all the vaccines

[31/10/21, 11:51:01 PM] Vikram: Trolling is part of the game but the way we lost the 2 games is really disappointing. In both the games right from the 1st ball we never had an iota of winning chance
[31/10/21, 11:53:00 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: Absolutely, it is very disappointing. I was expecting a better game plan, more determination after drubbing by Pak!
[01/11/21, 2:17:53 AM] Srikanth Palle: Happy bday Kevin!
Very sorry Suhail that we could not make it. I have not been keeping well lately and didn’t want to take any risk.
[01/11/21, 2:22:19 AM] Srikanth Palle: I missed the game today. Have been sleeping the whole time. Just saw the highlights and have one observation. All the catches today would have been sixers in ipl. IPL is to blame. All those batsmen who are tigers in ipl are cats if the boundaries are of regular size.
[01/11/21, 2:25:19 AM] Vikram: Tweet this to ICC they will make sure the boundaries are in sync with IPL
[01/11/21, 8:09:19 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Np bro, I understand.  We can catch up later sometime.  👍
[01/11/21, 8:13:05 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Thank you all for coming and being a part of the celebration. Felt really happy to see you around with families. I'll share some pics of yours when I get a soft copy. 👍🙏🏻

[01/11/21, 7:02:23 PM] Srikanth Palle: He said yes sir ... “I know that sir. He does a lot of exercise and workout.”
[01/11/21, 7:03:19 PM] Srikanth Palle: The I thought to myself there is no one in our group who is a workout guy. Or is there anyone?
[01/11/21, 7:03:57 PM] Srikanth Palle: Not counting the folks in defence service who are fit.
[01/11/21, 7:17:49 PM] Suhail Ambrose: Bah..he may not know me..It was just one job. I have a habit of saving numbers of good gig workers.

[01/11/21, 7:20:44 PM] Srikanth Palle: Working this group
[01/11/21, 7:21:54 PM] Srikanth Palle: Lot of corporations are doing it. We should have some kind of competition in our group reg fitness goals. 
What day guys? Some thing like weekly steps count, calorie burn count etc.
[01/11/21, 7:22:01 PM] Srikanth Palle: It will be fun and helpful too
[01/11/21, 7:22:14 PM] Srikanth Palle: We can pool in money and the winner get a prize

Though initially embarrassed and uneasy over sharing a cabin, they went to bed, he in the upper berth and she in the lower.

At 1:00 AM, they were both still wide awake and they both knew it.

He said: "I'm sorry to bother you, but would you be willing to reach into the closet under your bed to get me a second blanket? I'm awfully cold."

"I have a better idea," she replied "Just for tonight,...... let's pretend that we're married."

"That's a great idea!", he said, now totally aroused.

"Good," she replied. "Get your own fucking blanket."

After a moment of silence, he farted and did not care.

Its Logical, Illogical, Ironical 😊

*"The Covid Paradox : “Why Can't I Get Inside Unvaccinated?"*
—————————————————
Helen: ‘You can’t come in here!’

Ivan: ‘Why not?’

Helen: ‘Well because you’re unvaccinated.’

Ivan: ‘But I’m not sick.’

Helen: ‘It doesn’t matter.’

Ivan: ‘Well, why does that guy get to go in?’

Helen: ‘Because he’s vaccinated.’

Ivan: ‘But he’s sick!’

Helen: ‘It’s alright. Everyone in here is vaccinated.’

Ivan: ‘Wait a minute. Are you saying everyone in there is vaccinated?’

Helen: ‘Yes.’

Ivan: ‘So then why can’t I go in there if everyone is vaccinated?’

Helen: ‘Because you’ll make them sick.’

Ivan: ‘How will I make them sick if I’m NOT sick and they’re vaccinated?’

Helen: ‘Because you’re unvaccinated.’

Ivan: ‘But they’re vaccinated.’

Helen: ‘But they can still get sick.’

Ivan: ‘So what the heck does the vaccine do?'

Helen: ‘It protects them.'

Ivan: ‘So vaccinated people can’t spread COVID?’

Helen: ‘Oh no. They can spread COVID just as easily as an unvaccinated person.’

Ivan: ‘I don’t even know what I’m hearing anymore. Look. I’m not sick.'

Helen: ‘Ok.’

Ivan: ‘And the guy you let in IS sick.’

Helen: ‘That’s right.’

Ivan: ‘And everybody in there can still get sick even though they’re vaccinated.’

Helen: ‘Certainly.’

Ivan: ‘So why can’t I go in again?’

Helen: ‘Because you’re unvaccinated.’

Ivan: ‘I’m not asking who’s vaccinated or not!’

Helen: ‘I’m just telling you how it is.’

Ivan: ‘Nevermind. I’ll just put on my mask.’

Helen: ‘That’s fine.’

Ivan: ‘Now I can go in?’

Helen: ‘Absolutely not!’

Ivan: ‘But I have a mask on!’

Helen: ‘Doesn’t matter.’

Ivan: ‘I was able to come in here yesterday with a mask on.’

Helen: ‘I know.’

Ivan: So why can’t I come in here today with a mask on? ….If you say ‘because I’m unvaccinated’ again, I’ll break your arm.’

Helen: ‘Take it easy, buddy.’

Ivan: ‘So the mask is no good anymore.’

Helen: ‘No, it’s still good.’

Ivan: ‘But I can’t come in?’

Helen: ‘Correct.’

Ivan: ‘Why not?’

Helen: ‘Because you’re unvaccinated.’

Ivan: ‘But the mask prevents the germs from getting out.’

Helen: ‘Yes, but people can still catch your germs.’

Ivan: ‘But they’re all vaccinated.’

Helen: ‘Yes, but they can still get sick.’

Ivan: ‘But I’m not sick!!’

Helen: ‘But you can get sick. You need to be protected, that's why you can't come in.'

Ivan: ‘But if I pay money for an RT-PCR test and prove that I'm not sick, I can come in and you don't have to protect me anymore?'

Helen: ‘Yea, coz it proves that you are not sick and they can't get sick from you’

Ivan: ‘I thought you said you want to protect me from getting sick? But now you say if I'm proven to be healthy, then I can enter cos I can't get the vaccinated people sick. So how in the heck does that work?'

Helen: ‘Because you are unvaccinated and vaccinated people can catch your germs and get sick'

Ivan: 'So isn’t really to protect me from getting sick, is it?'

Helen:' I'm just doing my job, I don't know anything... '
[22/01/22, 2:16:47 PM] Avinash Rajendran: Good one!!!

The donkey told the tiger, "The grass is blue." 

The tiger replied, "No, the grass is green ."

The discussion became heated, and the two decided to submit the issue to arbitration, so they approached the lion. 

As they approached the lion on his throne, the donkey started screaming: ′′Your Highness, isn't it true that the grass is blue?" 

The lion replied: "If you believe it is true, the grass is blue." 

The donkey rushed forward and continued: ′′The tiger disagrees with me, contradicts me and annoys me. Please punish him."

The king then declared: ′′The tiger will be punished with 3 days of silence." 

The donkey jumped with joy and went on his way, content and repeating ′′The grass is blue, the grass is blue..." 

The tiger asked the lion, "Your Majesty, why have you punished me, after all, the grass is green?" 

The lion replied, ′′You've known and seen the grass is green."

The tiger asked, ′′So why do you punish me?" 

The lion replied, "That has nothing to do with the question of whether the grass is blue or green. The punishment is because it is degrading for a brave, intelligent creature like you to waste time arguing with an ass, and on top of that, you came and bothered me with that question just to validate something you already knew was true!"

The biggest waste of time is arguing with the fool and fanatic who doesn't care about truth or reality, but only the victory of his beliefs and illusions. 

Never waste time on discussions that make no sense. There are people who, for all the evidence presented to them, do not have the ability to understand. Others are blinded by ego, hatred and resentment, and the only thing that they want is to be right even if they aren’t. 

When IGNORANCE SCREAMS, intelligence moves on...

[05/02/22, 12:13:15 PM] Vikramaditya Singh: During World War II, fighter planes would come back from battle with bullet holes. The Allies found the areas that were most commonly hit by enemy fire. They sought to strengthen the most commonly damaged parts of the planes to reduce the number that was shot down.  A mathematician, Abraham Wald, pointed out that perhaps there was another way to look at the data. Perhaps the reason certain areas of the planes weren't covered in bullet holes was that planes that were shot in those areas did not return. This insight led to the armor being re-enforced on the parts of the plane where there were no bullet holes.  The story behind the data is arguably more important than the data itself. Or more precisely, the reason behind why we are missing certain pieces of data may be more meaningful than the data we have.

[25/04/22, 7:22:53 PM] Vikram: I don’t think so, they will give some stupid reason on Sunday and someone will propose them to continue
[25/04/22, 7:23:37 PM] Suhail Ambrose: He is not competent enough to write an essay
[25/04/22, 7:24:05 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: 😁
[25/04/22, 7:24:06 PM] Vikram: That was Aditya Chandra, Arun’s brother
[25/04/22, 7:24:25 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Ohhh yaa
[25/04/22, 7:24:30 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Aditya
[25/04/22, 7:24:30 PM] Suhail Ambrose: Yeah, it was Aditya
[25/04/22, 7:25:01 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: What was that he is pointing about sangam and estimatioy
[25/04/22, 7:25:05 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Estimation
[25/04/22, 7:30:31 PM] Suhail Ambrose: One month is already done, will it not take 2 months to finalize on by-laws, and I believe Hrmanth also need to be present for new asso registration,  so he needs to think of his travel as well
[25/04/22, 7:31:41 PM] Suhail Ambrose: Why are we in favor of deregistering, may be I missed something somewhere..can't we have the same registration and just change the leadership
[25/04/22, 8:30:25 PM] Srikanth Palle: Everyone has their own agenda. I’m not going to participate further in the discussion and plan to quit the group soon.
[25/04/22, 8:30:45 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Very good decision 👍😁
[25/04/22, 8:31:13 PM] Srikanth Palle: Yesterday you made all the calls and today they are friends again.
[25/04/22, 8:31:35 PM] Srikanth Palle: What’s happening? 
Don’t say gaju penkulu... special effects
[25/04/22, 8:31:44 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Hahaha
[25/04/22, 8:31:47 PM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Why should you quit ??
[25/04/22, 8:32:02 PM] Srikanth Palle: Or be dormant
[25/04/22, 8:32:03 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Who became friends mama
[25/04/22, 8:32:09 PM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Stay and give feedback or don’t give feedback. Quitting is not the solution.
[25/04/22, 8:32:17 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Tell me I will talk to Nellore peddareddy
[25/04/22, 8:33:34 PM] Suhail Ambrose: Can someone help me understand
[25/04/22, 8:34:24 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: But leader is not leaving ship she caught very tightly and make war on us
[25/04/22, 8:34:34 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Making*
[25/04/22, 8:36:21 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Finally what I say izzzz just chill

[25/04/22, 8:36:39 PM] Suhail Ambrose: It's not like that, she has told me several times that she will  not be a part of association anymore
[25/04/22, 8:37:13 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Everyone is saying different different conversation about them
[25/04/22, 8:37:26 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Now who is corressst
[25/04/22, 8:38:17 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: When she doesn't want to continue ask her to quit now wen everyone is against her except few
[25/04/22, 8:40:34 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: What ever sangam was started by us so our batch is founder of alumni some unknown ppl suddenly comes and takes credit I won't tolerate
[25/04/22, 8:41:17 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Because

[25/04/22, 8:41:38 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Adi matter
[25/04/22, 8:43:08 PM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Hmm I also think we should just change the leadership
[25/04/22, 8:43:36 PM] Vikram: I think we should
[25/04/22, 8:44:37 PM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: No need to deregister and start adding members
[25/04/22, 8:45:34 PM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: We can also say that the sanman event done was no way affiliated to the alumni association and any funds raised etc are all personal and not related to association. So we file association taxes next year, these donations/contributions and expenses should not be accounted
[25/04/22, 8:48:05 PM] Vikramaditya Singh: 👍🏼

[25/04/22, 10:06:05 PM] Srikanth Palle: It’s the truth btw
[25/04/22, 10:41:34 PM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: You did not control Hemanth while you were the head boy. You just focused on someone else 😉
[25/04/22, 11:20:28 PM] Suhail Ambrose: Kuch bhi bolo, I liked the way Aarthis batch stood up for her. Ppl from nowhere, who never put a chat,  all rose up at once after that video.

[26/04/22, 12:04:20 AM] Srikanth Palle: I didn’t see more than 5 ppl from her batch supporting.
[26/04/22, 12:05:53 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Atleast 5 enough mama for yest Vikram message how of our class mates gave 👍?
[26/04/22, 12:06:04 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Many*
[26/04/22, 12:06:19 AM] Srikanth Palle: 5 kuda leru mama
[26/04/22, 12:07:04 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Adey kada
[26/04/22, 12:07:21 AM] Srikanth Palle: I’m telling not even 5 supporting her
[26/04/22, 12:07:28 AM] Srikanth Palle: You guys got more 👍
[26/04/22, 12:07:39 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Don't remind vikram about his yest chat
[26/04/22, 12:07:45 AM] Srikanth Palle: Lol 😂
[26/04/22, 12:08:14 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: That we called and msgd so we got r else no body was ready to 👍
[26/04/22, 12:08:22 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: 😂😂
‎[26/04/22, 12:09:06 AM] Suhail Ambrose: ‎image omitted
[26/04/22, 12:09:25 AM] Suhail Ambrose: There were a few guys who pvt chat too
[26/04/22, 12:09:37 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Hmm
[26/04/22, 12:10:00 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: These personal chats only kompa munching 😉
[26/04/22, 12:10:03 AM] Srikanth Palle: But why? If the point was right it would have come organically. 
I’ll tell why. Many people could see through the agenda of one of our batch mate. It’s not rocket science. It was made into us vs them instead of “do the right thing”
[26/04/22, 12:12:42 AM] Suhail Ambrose: I have the exact same feeling
[26/04/22, 12:13:09 AM] Srikanth Palle: Whoever that Soumya was, she asked the right questions.
[26/04/22, 12:14:25 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: What is there in alumni group was there any against leadership no nothing ppl are only putting big big messages for felicitation program sisters support and aarthi support apart from that do u find anything
[26/04/22, 12:14:40 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: What did she ask ?
[26/04/22, 12:14:44 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: I don't know
[26/04/22, 12:15:20 AM] Srikanth Palle: @919177749313 add Sravan to the group.
[26/04/22, 12:15:27 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: No need
[26/04/22, 12:15:31 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: 🙏
[26/04/22, 12:15:48 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: If u add also I don't find messages
[26/04/22, 12:15:51 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Previous
[26/04/22, 12:16:33 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: I m only fighting because some unknown person says founder and president of alumni group
[26/04/22, 12:16:37 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: And wat r we
[26/04/22, 12:16:58 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: And she decides who should be alumni and who not
[26/04/22, 12:17:06 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Who gave rights to her
[26/04/22, 12:17:38 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: I studied till 7 th in school   so according to her I m not alumni
[26/04/22, 12:17:41 AM] Srikanth Palle: By laws are not yet formed mama.
[26/04/22, 12:17:42 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Bc
[26/04/22, 12:18:34 AM] Suhail Ambrose: If you notice, hemanths ' dear Alumni' wala chat and vikrams ' I propose'  wala chat got overlapped. It looked like people were giving 👍 to hemanths 'dear alumni' chat because vikram also went back on hemanths chat and gave his ' I propose wala chat' . Though thumbs up was vikrams ask.
[26/04/22, 12:18:36 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: I stayed in nird for 30 years and I was nycc president for 7 years anonymously I studied in school for four years
[26/04/22, 12:19:34 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: She is not even known to anyone and non nirdian she decides us
[26/04/22, 12:19:40 AM] Srikanth Palle: My question is .... did those voted help?

[26/04/22, 12:20:08 AM] Srikanth Palle: The votes*
[26/04/22, 12:20:22 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Anonymous nahi  unanimously
[26/04/22, 12:20:28 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Yes few got calls from them but they didn't receive
[26/04/22, 12:20:42 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Wahi Mera English teacher 😉
[26/04/22, 12:21:13 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Got calls from committee. Founder and president
[26/04/22, 12:22:15 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Yes, they helped fuel the anger of superseniors, Archana sent me a very long msg this morning crying and cribbing on those thumbsups
[26/04/22, 12:22:32 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Some how for yesterday Vikram message we came to know how few batches are against to present committee
[26/04/22, 12:22:35 AM] Srikanth Palle: Even if you received 100 votes neither party is ready to listen and reason. You, Aditya, Hiteshwar and all made strong logical arguments. It’s now us vs them. So how much ever logic you guys pour into the conversation none of the parties will pay heed.
[26/04/22, 12:23:23 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: She is an nit right and we are fighting. And you don’t want to fight
[26/04/22, 12:23:29 AM] Suhail Ambrose: ‎This message was deleted.
[26/04/22, 12:23:35 AM] Srikanth Palle: When I say us* it’s not us as a batch. I meant two opposing parties
[26/04/22, 12:23:57 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Which msg
[26/04/22, 12:23:57 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: I m already fighting annai
[26/04/22, 12:24:13 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Woh 👍 wala
[26/04/22, 12:25:19 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: By the way who is nit annai
[26/04/22, 12:25:30 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: The point is srikanth we should convey our feelings which I gladly did when this whole thing started
[26/04/22, 12:25:41 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: She studied in nit kya
[26/04/22, 12:25:43 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: ?
[26/04/22, 12:26:06 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: I know chandra Sekhar is a planted guy and he dances to the tunes of hemanth. But I took the opportunity and conveyed what I wanted to convey
[26/04/22, 12:26:07 AM] Srikanth Palle: Agree but it is becoming like “chaviti vadi mundu shankh am”
[26/04/22, 12:26:27 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: That’s ok.
[26/04/22, 12:26:45 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Change May come or may not. But we have to start with expressing our point.
[26/04/22, 12:26:48 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: And is Ada Chandra her brother ??
[26/04/22, 12:27:11 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Yesterday I spoke to shekar and told him not to respond on any messages in group did we get any messages?
[26/04/22, 12:27:13 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: I don’t care who ends up as the President or who runs the show. 

What they did was wrong and I am glad I expressed it
[26/04/22, 12:27:29 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: He is an ass hole. He is driving everything crazy
[26/04/22, 12:27:52 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Lolz iknow
[26/04/22, 12:27:53 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Honestly,  if you notice, it's becoming hemanth vs superseniors,  but actually,  ot should have been ' the organizers' vs ' the alumni'
[26/04/22, 12:28:25 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: It’s because of that chandra Sekhar and other people who are repeating the same message again and again.
[26/04/22, 12:28:26 AM] Srikanth Palle: Agree but won’t it look like we are pushing Hemanth’s agenda? 
I don’t like either party’s agenda.
[26/04/22, 12:28:34 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: But who supported her without voting ?
[26/04/22, 12:28:38 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: As president
[26/04/22, 12:28:48 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: Exactly!!
[26/04/22, 12:28:54 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: No one ...
[26/04/22, 12:28:57 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: Self declared
[26/04/22, 12:29:02 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: I don’t think so anna. 

We expressed our feelings. I don’t care what is Hemanth’s agenda.
[26/04/22, 12:30:03 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Hemanth did.i have evidence
[26/04/22, 12:30:12 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Eggzactly mama self declaration is allowed means I will declare myself as founder president,  vice president and all other positions 😉
[26/04/22, 12:30:40 AM] Srikanth Palle: Organisers did a major good up. Now instead of us asking for democracy we are making it Hemant’s play. 
Why should Hemanth be a part of the new working committee?
[26/04/22, 12:30:47 AM] Srikanth Palle: Goof*
[26/04/22, 12:31:08 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: One thing is for clear, the group is more interested in portraying their individual achievements. I don’t understand why. 

What we have to focus on is questioning why they did not inform everyone in the group. What’s the purpose of the group. 

That’s it. Go with just one agenda and kill it.
[26/04/22, 12:31:20 AM] Srikanth Palle: I’m not against him getting elected. Which can happen and I’m ok with it.
[26/04/22, 12:31:25 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: We are asking him to be part of the play
[26/04/22, 12:31:38 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: If the discussion ever comes up I will say he is unfit
[26/04/22, 12:31:53 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Joining and leaving and sulking - do you think this is a joke ??
[26/04/22, 12:32:05 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Yes
[26/04/22, 12:32:14 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Either you stay and answer or get out forever.
[26/04/22, 12:32:15 AM] Srikanth Palle: Se democratically each batch should elect one representative and all those representatives should elect a body. 
Just like MPs and PM election.
[26/04/22, 12:32:24 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Me too
[26/04/22, 12:32:33 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: Ya ... Nobody is advocating that he should be an elected rep ... It is actually very unbecoming ...
[26/04/22, 12:33:08 AM] Srikanth Palle: Even my vote in our batch will go to Suhail.
[26/04/22, 12:33:34 AM] Srikanth Palle: He had this dream of alumni before his wet dreams started 😉
[26/04/22, 12:33:37 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: For that matter, whoever left and started talking in the back are all unfit. 

They can’t even answer the questions or consider the opinions of the members, how can they be leaders and so called gazetted officers or principals ??
[26/04/22, 12:34:15 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: 👍
[26/04/22, 12:34:39 AM] Suhail Ambrose: If ever call happen,  you should put this point strongly
[26/04/22, 12:34:51 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Absolutely I will.
[26/04/22, 12:35:38 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: And We should not entertain the call if a neutral moderator is not agreed upon.
[26/04/22, 12:35:41 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: Nobody is ever gonna get 2000 alumni on board ..  so what is the harm in the 230 odd who are member of that group to decide ... It is ideal to have  classwise representation .. but who is to ascertain that the rep is actually representation of that class ..
[26/04/22, 12:35:50 AM] Srikanth Palle: And most interesting part is neither of them know what to do after becoming the president or whatever position they are craving for.
No manifesto, no vision etc. 
Like dogs chasing the car
[26/04/22, 12:35:50 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Deciding here will nothing happens plz have some strong message like Aditya kept in the morning like half of the message introducing him self as black cat para commander and etc
[26/04/22, 12:35:51 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: 👍🏼
[26/04/22, 12:36:06 AM] Srikanth Palle: Why
[26/04/22, 12:36:07 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: 😆😆
[26/04/22, 12:36:53 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: That was a joke man ... And I feel sad that his family had to resort to that to justify their actions ...
[26/04/22, 12:36:57 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: And kick those people out or mute them if they are repeating the same information again and again or doing any personal allegations.
[26/04/22, 12:37:43 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: I m telling u guys to react in group mama wen there brothers are supporting her sister why can't we
[26/04/22, 12:37:45 AM] Srikanth Palle: My suggestion. Form another alumni association. Move all the folks there. Let this alumni assn be there with the few folks.
[26/04/22, 12:37:54 AM] Suhail Ambrose: My involvement in recent days might give impressions that I am eyeing on a position. But honestly,  I am not. You can take this screenshot and challenge me if that ever happens in future. 
2 reasons,  I am personally not invested in the idea of ' saving the school ' and I don't have time. 
Nevertheless,  it's my character to speak up when something wrong is being done.
[26/04/22, 12:38:10 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: 1. Max 2 mins for every person who wants to share his/her feelings
2. set time for explanations from other side. 
3. Suggestions and next steps 
We need to run the call with focus and discipline
[26/04/22, 12:38:18 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: 😉
[26/04/22, 12:38:21 AM] Srikanth Palle: Even then my vote is for you.
[26/04/22, 12:39:23 AM] Srikanth Palle: No mama. I meant why say I’m that and this? We as alumni should all be treated with respect irrespective of what the person is doing.
[26/04/22, 12:39:29 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: I give a damn about who is the president and all. 

All I want is an explanation on why this was kept dark and concealed. That’s it
[26/04/22, 12:39:39 AM] Suhail Ambrose: 😇 feels good that you feel I am deserving.
[26/04/22, 12:39:55 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: Hail suhail even my vote is for you ...
[26/04/22, 12:40:08 AM] Srikanth Palle: Saving the school should not be the agenda
[26/04/22, 12:40:16 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: Nobody is gonna give any explanation hittu
[26/04/22, 12:40:17 AM] Srikanth Palle: Alumni assn is to help people.
[26/04/22, 12:40:26 AM] Srikanth Palle: It’s a community of people helping each other
[26/04/22, 12:40:58 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Yaa what u said was correct respect every one  mama but not these ppl
[26/04/22, 12:40:59 AM] Srikanth Palle: Saving the school was also all hamenth’s emotional push.
[26/04/22, 12:41:21 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: Precisely whether the school stays or goes .. the assn should always be there ... It is as if it is related to infrastructure ...
[26/04/22, 12:41:29 AM] Srikanth Palle: Institutions get closed but that does not erase our memories
[26/04/22, 12:41:40 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Correst
[26/04/22, 12:41:41 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: 👍
[26/04/22, 12:42:51 AM] Srikanth Palle: I still remember watching porn and 99 world cup in our library!!!
[26/04/22, 12:43:04 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Then they prove themselves to be unfit. 

If I had reasons to do everything in the background, I will share it
[26/04/22, 12:43:15 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Yellow floppy ??
[26/04/22, 12:43:38 AM] Srikanth Palle: I think that was in 7th
[26/04/22, 12:43:48 AM] Srikanth Palle: Or 8th
[26/04/22, 12:44:22 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: 8th Jyothi mam was the class teacher and she was upset
[26/04/22, 12:44:24 AM] Srikanth Palle: Why is Vikram Sai Kumar silent? Give him 2 pegs
[26/04/22, 12:44:37 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: What ever it may be wake me up after  new committee forms 😁
[26/04/22, 12:45:44 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: And I don't want to see next time in group ladies harrasment messages, and designation presentation like today he gave 😉
[26/04/22, 12:45:58 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Me too.
[26/04/22, 12:46:25 AM] Suhail Ambrose: It was something most craziest we did
[26/04/22, 12:46:31 AM] Vikram: I was not expecting this message from you Suhail. Practice what you preach
[26/04/22, 12:47:04 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Shuru hogaya
[26/04/22, 12:47:05 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: 😂

[26/04/22, 12:49:50 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Lage raho munna bhai 😂😉

[26/04/22, 12:54:37 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: I propose we make Sravan the new president.
[26/04/22, 12:54:49 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: 🙏
[26/04/22, 12:54:58 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Sri, hitt, adi, vik - I am looking for your feedback on this statement: if you notice, it's becoming hemanth vs superseniors,  but actually,  ot should have been ' the organizers' vs ' the alumni'
[26/04/22, 12:55:01 AM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Ok good night
[26/04/22, 12:55:15 AM] Srikanth Palle: I gave my opinion in the group
[26/04/22, 12:55:21 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Lets make it organizers Vs alumni
[26/04/22, 12:55:24 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: That’s it.
[26/04/22, 12:55:28 AM] Vikram: Yes
[26/04/22, 12:55:31 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Hemanth is out. Is
[26/04/22, 12:55:38 AM] Vikram: 👍
[26/04/22, 12:56:06 AM] Srikanth Palle: Almost all the time he is
[26/04/22, 12:56:16 AM] Srikanth Palle: He would be using some else to pass the info
[26/04/22, 12:56:27 AM] Srikanth Palle: Or might have a back up WhatsApp account on some other name
[26/04/22, 12:56:37 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Just corner them with the same question “why did you not share?” Where are the members and how did you form an association without informing ithers 

That’s it
‎[26/04/22, 12:56:40 AM] Srikanth Palle: ‎GIF omitted
[26/04/22, 12:57:38 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: There is a nice Facebook group that got silent. They used to share pictures etc now that’s all dropped
[26/04/22, 12:58:07 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Also they will use shiva nag card. I know he is senior and all, but I will voice my opinion against him also if needed
[26/04/22, 12:58:10 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Is this your ans sri?
[26/04/22, 12:58:29 AM] Srikanth Palle: This is exactly what I mentioned earlier
[26/04/22, 12:58:42 AM] Srikanth Palle: Go ahead with this man
[26/04/22, 12:59:54 AM] Srikanth Palle: It should be organisers vs alumni.
[26/04/22, 1:00:15 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Good that all of us think alike.
[26/04/22, 1:02:43 AM] Vikram: I don’t know how will the call be managed. I think we all would be muted and it would be a single way monologue. We will be left with more questions than answers
[26/04/22, 1:03:21 AM] Srikanth Palle: If we don’t agree on the moderator then we should not attend
‎[26/04/22, 1:03:49 AM] Vikram: ‎video omitted
[26/04/22, 1:05:36 AM] Suhail Ambrose: In this episode,  I must confess one thing,  I've been manipulated, and I am ashamed that i am fooled. Hemanth told me that he was the one who was in favor of communicating to the alumni, he sent some chat screenshots, I validated and believed. And so put a chat in the grp that I had validated hemanths chats and that he was in favor of communicating to larger alumni. I'd hate to share chat screenshots , but I'll consider as an exception this time.
[26/04/22, 1:07:17 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Absolutely,
[26/04/22, 1:07:19 AM] Srikanth Palle: Don’t be ashamed if you get fooled by a man once but be, if that happens again! 
- by Srikanth
[26/04/22, 1:07:45 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: And I think we made that clear today with Vidya. He was dodging that question.
[26/04/22, 1:07:49 AM] Vikram: For Sri sri prefix
[26/04/22, 1:07:50 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: So did u get duped??
[26/04/22, 1:08:02 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: Was he not in favour of communication
[26/04/22, 1:08:38 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Anxious now
[26/04/22, 1:09:40 AM] Srikanth Palle: Btw what communication?
[26/04/22, 1:09:42 AM] Vikram: Even he told me the same. Can anyone here confirm the YouTube video link was shared at the last hour in the alumni group by Hemanth?
[26/04/22, 1:10:08 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: I think somebody already brought out.. it is most likely going to turn out to be a monologue if they are not in favour of giving justification ..
[26/04/22, 1:10:12 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Yes he did
[26/04/22, 1:10:31 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: He got me part of that group by saying that it is an effort by all alumni
[26/04/22, 1:10:51 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Will physically come to india and f**k them 

I have Sohail and Vikram on my back. 😊
[26/04/22, 1:10:59 AM] Srikanth Palle: You both should be ashamed!
[26/04/22, 1:11:01 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Wait. Don't chat anything
[26/04/22, 1:11:13 AM] Suhail Ambrose: My phone battery was dead
[26/04/22, 1:11:13 AM] Vikram: Hmmm, I was told that the committee was reluctant to share the YouTube link to the bigger group
[26/04/22, 1:12:05 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: I think he told people what they wanted to hear to make them involved .. such a shame ..
[26/04/22, 1:12:07 AM] Srikanth Palle: Veedu veedi aaratam
[26/04/22, 1:12:55 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Wait...dontchat anything otherwise it will get confusing

[26/04/22, 1:15:06 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: But I don't know .. he spoke to me and at that time he told me that he himself had been hoodwinked by the organiser .. and someone told me that he had a big falling out with the organisers as they didn't want the main alumni group to be involved ...
[26/04/22, 1:15:41 AM] Srikanth Palle: 007 nikla tu
[26/04/22, 1:15:56 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Wait don't chat anything now
[26/04/22, 1:16:46 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Looking at this chats, anyone would feel that Hemanth was in favor of communicating to larger grp ,isn't it. So was i convinced
[26/04/22, 1:17:30 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Now I am going to send some more screen shots that Archana sent today, that made me feel popat
[26/04/22, 1:17:39 AM] Srikanth Palle: Why didn’t he ? You should have asked that
[26/04/22, 1:17:46 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Wait re
[26/04/22, 1:17:51 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: U r confusing me ... Was he in favour or not??
[26/04/22, 1:17:57 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Wait man.
[26/04/22, 1:17:58 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Bhai saab
[26/04/22, 1:18:02 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Wait
[26/04/22, 1:18:18 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: You have patience to Write loooooooooong text messages. Wait for this.
[26/04/22, 1:19:02 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Archana and Arun kept telling me that they asked hemanth to communicate to alumni and our grp...but I didn't believe them and thought they were bluffing..but reading the below msgs, I was disappointed
[26/04/22, 1:19:21 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Pls don't chat anything unless I say

[26/04/22, 1:20:21 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Today.
[26/04/22, 1:20:52 AM] Vikram: What does has to say about it now then?
‎[26/04/22, 1:21:22 AM] Suhail Ambrose: ‎image omitted
[26/04/22, 1:22:46 AM] Suhail Ambrose: So you see..incomplete screenshots, without timing, previous context and background are sent. These could be manipulating and misguiding.
[26/04/22, 1:23:19 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Now u can opine
[26/04/22, 1:23:27 AM] Vikram: Exactly, I was trying to see timestamp on the Hemanth’s screenshots
[26/04/22, 1:23:28 AM] Srikanth Palle: Bottom line ... Pearl heights ko bana diya usne ??
[26/04/22, 1:24:22 AM] Srikanth Palle: And Vikram ne merko. Next time Kelli pakka alchohol level checking meter patkoni thirigutha
[26/04/22, 1:24:29 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: My assumption - Hemanth is right. 

Initially they said YES. But later they asked him to stop explicitly.
[26/04/22, 1:24:51 AM] Srikanth Palle: Could be.
[26/04/22, 1:24:53 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: I will also raise my voice on "Top Secret Group"
[26/04/22, 1:25:11 AM] Srikanth Palle: Mama evadu vintaledu
[26/04/22, 1:25:16 AM] Vikram: Are you part of the group?
[26/04/22, 1:25:19 AM] Suhail Ambrose: There are 9 groups itseams
[26/04/22, 1:25:52 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Archana's screenshots are from 26th March
[26/04/22, 1:25:58 AM] Vikram: @919177749313 what was Archana saying to you?
[26/04/22, 1:26:05 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: See the time stamp on PayTM payment 🙂
[26/04/22, 1:26:32 AM] Srikanth Palle: Prabhava, vibhava, pramoduta, prajotpakti, musti, kapitva, katakamukha, ardha chandra ....
[26/04/22, 1:27:15 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Same thing that I put on grp yest- unopenionated and unbiased facts wala chat
[26/04/22, 1:28:28 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Hemanth Screenshots are recent. They say "4 days before the event"
‎[26/04/22, 1:29:25 AM] Suhail Ambrose: ‎image omitted
[26/04/22, 1:29:53 AM] Vikram: They were one team but only when people started questioning Hemanth was the first to abandon the ship
[26/04/22, 1:30:17 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Pls don't fwd these screenshot to any one..its a request,  you have just seen how things can be manipulated
[26/04/22, 1:30:19 AM] Srikanth Palle: This makes total sense.
[26/04/22, 1:30:42 AM] Srikanth Palle: Top secret group has been for a long time I believe
[26/04/22, 1:30:58 AM] Srikanth Palle: Kick all these people out and form a different alumni group
[26/04/22, 1:31:07 AM] Vikram: Needless to say
[26/04/22, 1:31:22 AM] Srikanth Palle: You should have mentioned this first
[26/04/22, 1:31:29 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Agreed.
[26/04/22, 1:31:55 AM] Srikanth Palle: I forwarded it to all 9 groups
[26/04/22, 1:32:10 AM] Srikanth Palle: These ones
[26/04/22, 1:32:11 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Which groups ?
[26/04/22, 1:32:23 AM] Srikanth Palle: Kidding mama
[26/04/22, 1:32:30 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Seriously these groups exist >
[26/04/22, 1:32:36 AM] Srikanth Palle: Nah nah
[26/04/22, 1:32:37 AM] Suhail Ambrose: I don't think you are so social that you would post something in 9 grps
[26/04/22, 1:32:46 AM] Srikanth Palle: I remember our music sir teaching us these
[26/04/22, 1:33:15 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Vidya Babu also left the group ?
[26/04/22, 1:33:41 AM] Srikanth Palle: All these people are not doing this for the right reasons 
Make a new group
[26/04/22, 1:33:50 AM] Vikram: Lol
[26/04/22, 1:33:59 AM] Srikanth Palle: I’ll register a new group
[26/04/22, 1:34:19 AM] Srikanth Palle: Nird Bvbv alumni association
[26/04/22, 1:34:36 AM] Srikanth Palle: Change the name and there you have your answer
[26/04/22, 1:35:24 AM] Vikram: Ok, what now?
[26/04/22, 1:36:09 AM] Vikram: How do we include Hemanth as well along with the committee? Can we do it at first place? I feel he is equally responsible now
[26/04/22, 1:38:12 AM] Suhail Ambrose: I don't think quitters and sulkers have right mindset and should hold a position of power or key position. Can be advisors though.
[26/04/22, 1:39:00 AM] Srikanth Palle: There should be voting
[26/04/22, 1:39:03 AM] Suhail Ambrose: But If not him, the asso will remain to be namesake and mediocre one
[26/04/22, 1:39:13 AM] Vikramaditya Singh: Manipulation at a different level ..
[26/04/22, 1:40:23 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Their advice is to quit when something is not working
[26/04/22, 1:41:02 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: You have to make up your mind. If you decide to share to alumni - Just Share it. If you decide not to, stick to the plan and be ready to defend your decision. If the decision is wrong, face it like a man and say sorry.
[26/04/22, 1:41:39 AM] Vikram: Its just not about working....i do not think they are deemed fit to work
[26/04/22, 1:41:46 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: He changed his mind several times. I will share, may be there will be issues, its late and people are pointing fingers ate me etc etc etc. Lets not think too much about him. BUT in the call, we need to expose the real culprit - Who ever it might be
[26/04/22, 1:42:26 AM] Vikram: All of them that includes Hemanth
[26/04/22, 1:42:37 AM] Srikanth Palle: I’m the culprit
‎[26/04/22, 1:42:41 AM] Srikanth Palle: ‎image omitted
[26/04/22, 1:42:44 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: If we decide to register a formal association, we need memberships. PAID memberships. We need to do a membership drive to make members. If we have 300+ paid members, we are good.
[26/04/22, 1:42:51 AM] Suhail Ambrose: I am also very unimpressed with this Rama. I don't know who he is. Well seams to be a supersenior, just dum dabaka bhaga when the harassment issue happened yest. Don't chat anything and see this drama now
[26/04/22, 1:43:04 AM] Vikram: 😂😂😂
‎[26/04/22, 1:43:34 AM] Suhail Ambrose: ‎image omitted
[26/04/22, 1:43:44 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: All because of Srikanth. You did not train Hemanth nicely. 🙂
[26/04/22, 1:44:13 AM] Srikanth Palle: 😂
[26/04/22, 1:44:49 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Where is our @919985646612 ??? He is also the culprit. He was the mentor for Hemanth 🙂
[26/04/22, 1:45:06 AM] Suhail Ambrose: So as soon I alerted him that  admins might get in trouble, he made Arun the admin and immediately quit the group.
[26/04/22, 1:45:49 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Is it how a senior person behaves..
[26/04/22, 1:46:15 AM] Srikanth Palle: If he is who I’m thinking he is then he is a nice chap. But very susceptible to manipulation.
[26/04/22, 1:46:16 AM] Vikram: He and Hemanth used to do Top secret combined studies together with Kavitha and Chandana
[26/04/22, 1:47:37 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Well you should stop calling him a nice chap.
[26/04/22, 1:47:37 AM] Vikram: Yes I think he was your neighbour at Upparpally
[26/04/22, 1:47:53 AM] Srikanth Palle: No no. He was not
[26/04/22, 1:48:02 AM] Srikanth Palle: But I know that he is a nice chap
[26/04/22, 1:48:16 AM] Srikanth Palle: Why?
[26/04/22, 1:49:07 AM] Srikanth Palle: Just because he ran doesn’t make him a bad person .... may be coward .... but not bad 
I saw his messages today on the group
[26/04/22, 1:49:23 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: After Sunday's call, the only nice chap should be "Sohail Anna" 🙂 No one else
[26/04/22, 1:50:24 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Because he didn't control the situation, he quit when he felt thing were getting heated up. He was also a member of org committee.
[26/04/22, 1:50:28 AM] Srikanth Palle: Sohail Anna is like Ismail bhai and Hemanth like saleem pheku.
[26/04/22, 1:50:33 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: You know why Sohail will not get votes if there was an election ? He changed his name so many times. Every batch knew him with a different name 😜
[26/04/22, 1:50:47 AM] Vikram: 😂😂
[26/04/22, 1:50:54 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Just once!
[26/04/22, 1:51:42 AM] Srikanth Palle: It’s ok m. I mean I feel bad to be taking names and bitching. Will stop it here. Have nothing against anyone. just trying to stand with “dharma”
[26/04/22, 1:51:56 AM] Srikanth Palle: Good night folks
‎[26/04/22, 1:52:40 AM] Srikanth Palle: ‎image omitted
[26/04/22, 1:52:47 AM] Vikram: Alright guys, good night from my side as well. Let’s talk tomorrow
[26/04/22, 1:53:05 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Gn guys. 😴
[26/04/22, 1:53:51 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Fucker, you being chuddy buddy atleast should know my name..I am Suhail, not S'o' hail
[26/04/22, 1:54:18 AM] Vikram: 😂😂
[26/04/22, 1:54:27 AM] Srikanth Palle: Dharmo rakshati rakshitaha
[26/04/22, 1:54:43 AM] Vikram: This made me laugh very hard 🤣🤣
[26/04/22, 1:55:48 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Good Night Guys
[26/04/22, 1:55:55 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Fight for Dharma will continue 🙂
[26/04/22, 1:57:12 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Agree with this thought
[26/04/22, 1:58:12 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Hey subba..nice to hear from you
[26/04/22, 1:59:10 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Others in this grp, let me know if you want me to add you to the alumni grp, I can add you. You are missing a lot of drama
[26/04/22, 1:59:15 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Subba also joining out Dharma Poratam
[26/04/22, 1:59:35 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Just add - We need lot of representation from our batch. Always the highest 🙂
[26/04/22, 2:00:56 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Just was going through the long discussion in this channel .
[26/04/22, 2:01:32 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Thanks man..it was quite some time the group had such heavy activity as well 😊
[26/04/22, 2:02:03 AM] Vikram: Follow this link to join my WhatsApp group: https://chat.whatsapp.com/3YgXzWRKH2W6k6idg3ndNK
[26/04/22, 2:02:31 AM] Vikram: Friends who are not part of the group
[26/04/22, 2:02:40 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Bhaiyya anta pedda maatalu vaddu kani..Just felt like someone who started the association should be there standing by taking side of what's right ani ante
[26/04/22, 2:03:11 AM] Subba Rao BVB: I recollect the days when he asked me to cancel the group which I created for the 2001 batch of fb
[26/04/22, 2:03:32 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Who did that ? Who ? Who ? Lets break his head
[26/04/22, 2:04:08 AM] Vikram: WTF
[26/04/22, 2:04:28 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Hemanth ee but it was in the greater cause of getting a bigger group onboard
[26/04/22, 2:04:29 AM] Suhail Ambrose: Is it?
[26/04/22, 2:05:19 AM] Subba Rao BVB: No hard feelings on that. I felt justified with what he said as the school issue needed visibility and he needed a larger group
[26/04/22, 2:05:37 AM] Subba Rao BVB: To the best of my memory .. yes
[26/04/22, 2:07:09 AM] Subba Rao BVB: And the group I created might cause confusion
[26/04/22, 2:08:16 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: I spent few nice hours browsing the posts in this group. 

https://www.facebook.com/groups/bvbvnirdalumnicabinet

Nice pictures, old memories. I see pictures of Sangam 2012, but not 2011 (The big one). Looks like those pictures are also for the paid members. So this paid subscription to alumni events is a practice for more than 10 years. 🙂
[26/04/22, 2:09:24 AM] Subba Rao BVB: I felt this a genuine request and deleted it then.
[26/04/22, 2:11:29 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Suhail, Although you do not have any intention for any post I would like you to represent the batch as I believe you have been associated with this cause  for long now
[26/04/22, 2:14:05 AM] Subba Rao BVB: No hard feelings on anyone about cancelling the 2001 group on fb.. but going through the posts I just feel that the larger cause of saving the school should not take a backseat.
[26/04/22, 2:14:32 AM] Subba Rao BVB: It should be the way forward upon what needs to be done in the right manner with right communication
[26/04/22, 2:16:22 AM] Vikram: The whole issue of saving the school and forming an association is hijacked by few people. If we leave it the way it is, it will be a place for the few to promote themselves. 

Let’s fight for it and do our bit
[26/04/22, 2:17:36 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Bhaiyya not sure about what say can an association have.. but if my voice or opinion can help. Will definitely be glad to contribute 👍
[26/04/22, 2:18:16 AM] Subba Rao BVB: Help with regard to saving the school
[26/04/22, 2:19:00 AM] Vikram: 👍

[26/04/22, 1:19:59 PM] Suhail Ambrose: But why did we go to school that time
[26/04/22, 1:20:28 PM] Vikram: Even she doesn’t remember

[26/04/22, 1:42:20 PM] Sandeep Vallapu: This is Anupriya for sure! Thanks to Vikram's push during the class...etched in memory😜

[26/04/22, 1:46:27 PM] Vikram: Cheersmate!

[26/04/22, 6:39:55 PM] Vikram: He did come to hyd but not NIRD. Certainly photoshopped
[26/04/22, 7:21:58 PM] Suhail Ambrose: Ha ha..I think its a parent of student with albino. Just saw this pic in several other pics and he caught my attention, looked very familiar to Bill. SRAVAN- do you recognize him?
[26/04/22, 7:22:42 PM] Srikanth Palle: So much misinformation!!
[26/04/22, 7:22:57 PM] Suhail Ambrose: I like the way you think
[26/04/22, 7:23:05 PM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Today the group is silent except us. Looks like payoffs happened ?
[26/04/22, 7:23:18 PM] Suhail Ambrose: What sort of payoffs
[26/04/22, 7:23:19 PM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: No Chandra Sekhar, No hemanth, Prakash, Vidya, Rama, Aarti
[26/04/22, 7:23:37 PM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Settlements in the background You scratch my back and I will scratch your back

[27/04/22, 8:27:30 PM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: My next message in the BVBV NIRD group 

It’s sickening to see Head Boy of our batch leaving the group. He is taking moral responsibility in his failure to groom his fellow batch mates to be a model alumni. His failure has impact in all batches since 2001. 

😂😂😂
[27/04/22, 8:29:17 PM] Vikram: Headboy left because of Chandrashekara
[27/04/22, 8:38:54 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Dude add him back and warn him in the group itself but don't remove them
[27/04/22, 8:39:01 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: I spoke to him
[27/04/22, 8:39:13 PM] Srikanth Palle: No, I left because the discussion there is impacting me and I’m getting too involved. It’s better I let it go.
[27/04/22, 8:40:10 PM] Srikanth Palle: I accept my failure. 😉
[27/04/22, 8:40:37 PM] Suhail Ambrose: Oh you left, I didn't notice
[27/04/22, 8:41:00 PM] Suhail Ambrose: I told you, I need recommendations from 5 guys
[27/04/22, 8:41:30 PM] Sravan Nunsavath Naik: Hmmm
[27/04/22, 8:41:50 PM] Vikram: Yeah wait for few days and add him
[27/04/22, 8:42:23 PM] Srikanth Palle: It’s draining my mental bandwidth. I’d rather watch funny YouTube videos.
[27/04/22, 8:47:00 PM] Vikram: Yesterday he was talking about leadership. What leadership qualities are talking about? Doing the rudimentary things right? A 7th grade student would organise an event better with taking along all the stake holders
[27/04/22, 8:48:00 PM] Suhail Ambrose: I thought of 24 hrs
[27/04/22, 8:48:09 PM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: 48

[27/04/22, 10:40:58 PM] Suhail Ambrose: Did Srikanth try talk to hemanth

got Independence  
Indians have become CEOs of Google, Microsoft, Pepsico, Jaguar, Land Rover 
&
Pakistani have become heads of Taliban, Al-Qaeda, Jammat U Dawa, Hijbul Mujahideen 
What a contrast...... 
Adding a line to this joke 
India reached Mars and
Pakistan still trying to enter India .

& Finally,

They have a Moon on their Flag
And We have Our Flag on the Moon. 🇮🇳

[24/05/23, 1:42:44 PM] Vikram: A thief broke into a house one night. As he was shining his flashlight around looking for valuables he heard a faint voice say, "Jesus knows you're here."

The thief instantly froze but heard nothing else and continued on.

As he was rifling through a jewelry box he then heard, "Jesus is watching you."

Startled, he shined his light around frantically looking for the source of the voice. Over in the corner of the room his flashlight spotted a parrot in a cage.

The thief whispered, "Hey, was that you talking?"

"Yes," said the parrot. "I'm just trying to warn you that Jesus is watching you."

Relieved that it was just a bird the thief answered, "Warn me, huh? And just who are you?"

"Moses," replied the parrot.

"Moses?" the thief laughed. "What kind of a person would name a bird Moses?"

The parrot said, "The same kind of person who would name their Pit Bull Jesus."

[04/06/23, 2:31:47 AM] Hiteshwar Vadlamudi: Drive up the old campus road and all the houses are just hopeless. No maintenance nothing. 

Last December I drove over my house and it was a jungle inside and outside. Looks like no one is living and just abandoned all these houses 😞😞😞
